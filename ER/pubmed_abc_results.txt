AB  - The ABC protein superfamily-also called traffic ATPases-are energy-dependent 
      ubiquitous proteins, representing one of the crucial and the largest family in the 
      fungal genomes. The ATP-binding cassette endows a characteristic 200-250 amino acids 
      and is omnipresent in all organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Unlike 
      in bacteria with nutrient import functions, ABC transporters in fungal 
      entomopathogens serve as effective efflux pumps that are largely involved in the 
      shuttle of metabolites across the biological membranes. Thus, the search for ABC 
      proteins may prove of immense importance in elucidating the functional and molecular 
      mechanism at the host-pathogen (insect-fungus) interface. Their sequence homology, 
      domain topology, and functional traits led to the actual identification of nine 
      different families in fungal entomopathogens. Evolutionary relationships within the 
      ABC superfamily are discussed, concentrating on computational approaches for 
      comparative identification of ABC transporters in insect-pathogenic fungi 
      (entomopathogens) with those of animals, plants, and their bacterial orthologs. 
      Ancestors of some fungal candidates have duplicated extensively in some phyla, while 
      others were lost in one lineage or the other, and predictions for the cause of their 
      duplications and/or loss in some phyla are made. ABC transporters of fungal 
      insect-pathogens serve both defensive and offensive functions effective against 
      land-dwelling and ground foraging voracious insects. This study may help to unravel 
      the molecular cascades of ABC proteins to illuminate the means through which insects 
      cope with fungal infection and fungal-related diseases.

AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular defense against 
      xenobiotic compounds is a main research issue in medical and veterinary entomology, 
      as insecticide/acaricide resistance is a major threat in the control of arthropods. 
      ABC transporters are recognized as a component of the detoxifying mechanism in 
      arthropods. We investigated the possible involvement of ABC transporters in defense 
      to the organophosphate insecticide temephos in the malarial vector Anopheles 
      stephensi. We performed bioassays on larvae of An. stephensi, using insecticide 
      alone and in combination with ABC-transporter inhibitors, to assess synergism 
      between these compounds. Next, we investigated the expression profiles of six ABC 
      transporter genes in larvae exposed to temephos. Surprisingly, neither bioassays nor 
      gene expression analyses provided any evidence for a major role of ABC transporters 
      in defense against temephos in An. stephensi. We thus decided to review existing 
      literature to generate a record of other studies that failed to reveal a role for 
      ABC transporters against particular insecticides/acaricides. A review of the 
      scientific literature led to the recovery of 569 papers about ABC transporters; 
      among these, 50 involved arthropods, and 10 reported negative results. Our study on 
      An. stephensi and accompanying literature review highlight the heterogeneity that 
      exists in ABC transporter involvement in defense/resistance mechanisms in 
      arthropods.

TI  - Implicating ABC Transporters in Insecticide Resistance: Research Strategies and a 
      Decision Framework.
PG  - 667-677
LID - 10.1093/jee/tox041 [doi]
AB  - Pest insects damage crops, transmit diseases, and are household nuisances. 
      Historically, they have been controlled with insecticides, but overuse often leads 
      to resistance to one or more of these chemicals. Insects gain resistance to 
      insecticides through behavioral, metabolic, genetic, and physical mechanisms. One 
      frequently overlooked strategy is through the use of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporters. ABC transporters, present in all domains of life, perform natural 
      excretory functions, thus the exploitation of these transporters to excrete 
      insecticides and contribute to resistance is highly plausible. Previous work has 
      implicated ABC transporters in some cases of insecticide resistance. Proposed herein 
      is a framework meant as a formal guide for more easily incorporating the analysis of 
      ABC transporters into existing resistance monitoring using suggested simple research 
      methods. This framework functions as a simple decision tree and its utility is 
      demonstrated using case examples. Determining a role for ABC transporters in 
      insecticide resistance would help to shape future resistance management plans and 
      guide the design of new insecticides.

AB  - Precise genome editing is a valuable tool to study gene function in model organisms. 
      Prime editing, a precise editing system developed in mammalian cells, does not 
      require double-strand breaks or donor DNA and has low off-target effects. Here, we 
      applied prime editing for the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and developed 
      conditions for optimal editing. By expressing prime editing components in cultured 
      cells or somatic cells of transgenic flies, we precisely introduce premature stop 
      codons in three classical visible marker genes, ebony, white, and forked 
      Furthermore, by restricting editing to germ cells, we demonstrate efficient 
      germ-line transmission of a precise edit in ebony to 36% of progeny. Our results 
      suggest that prime editing is a useful system in Drosophila to study gene function, 
      such as engineering precise point mutations, deletions, or epitope tags.

      and Bt Insecticidal Activity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20112829 [doi]
LID - 2829
AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, a large class of transmembrane proteins, 
      are widely found in organisms and play an important role in the transport of 
      xenobiotics. Insect ABC transporters are involved in insecticide detoxification and 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin perforation. The complete ABC transporter is 
      composed of two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding 
      domains (NBDs). Conformational changes that are needed for their action are mediated 
      by ATP hydrolysis. According to the similarity among their sequences and 
      organization of conserved ATP-binding cassette domains, insect ABC transporters have 
      been divided into eight subfamilies (ABCA-ABCH). This review describes the functions 
      and mechanisms of ABC transporters in insecticide detoxification, plant toxic 
      secondary metabolites transport and insecticidal activity of Bt toxin. With improved 
      understanding of the role and mechanisms of ABC transporter in resistance to 
      insecticides and Bt toxins, we can identify valuable target sites for developing new 
      strategies to control pests and manage resistance and achieve green pest control.

AB  - In the last ten years, ABC transporters have emerged as unexpected yet significant 
      contributors to pest resistance to insecticidal pore-forming proteins from Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt). Evidence includes the presence of mutations in resistant 
      insects, heterologous expression to probe interactions with the three-domain Cry 
      toxins, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts. Yet the mechanisms by which ABC transporters 
      facilitate pore formation remain obscure. The three major classes of Cry toxins used 
      in agriculture have been found to target the three major classes of ABC 
      transporters, which requires a mechanistic explanation. Many other families of 
      bacterial pore-forming toxins exhibit conformational changes in their mode of 
      action, which are not yet described for the Cry toxins. Three-dimensional structures 
      of the relevant ABC transporters, the multimeric pore in the membrane, and other 
      proteins that assist in the process are required to test the hypothesis that the 
      ATP-switch mechanism provides a motive force that drives Cry toxins into the 
      membrane. Knowledge of the mechanism of pore insertion will be required to combat 
      the resistance that is now evolving in field populations of insects, including 
      noctuids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proteins from the ABC family (ATP-binding cassette) represent the 
      largest known group of efflux pumps, responsible for transporting specific molecules 
      across lipid membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In arthropods 
      they have been shown to play a role in insecticide defense/resistance. The presence 
      of ABC transporters and their possible association with insecticide transport have 
      not yet been investigated in the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, the major vector of 
      human malaria in the Middle East and South Asian regions. Here we investigated the 
      presence and role of ABCs in transport of permethrin insecticide in a susceptible 
      strain of this mosquito species. METHODS: To identify ABC transporter genes we 
      obtained a transcriptome from untreated larvae of An. stephensi and then compared it 
      with the annotated transcriptome of Anopheles gambiae. To analyse the association 
      between ABC transporters and permethrin we conducted bioassays with permethrin alone 
      and in combination with an ABC inhibitor, and then we investigated expression 
      profiles of the identified genes in larvae exposed to permethrin. RESULTS: Bioassays 
      showed an increased mortality of mosquitoes when permethrin was used in combination 
      with the ABC-transporter inhibitor. Genes for ABC transporters were detected in the 
      transcriptome, and five were selected (AnstABCB2, AnstABCB3, AnstABCB4, 
      AnstABCmember6 and AnstABCG4). An increased expression in one of them (AnstABCG4) 
      was observed in larvae exposed to the LD50 dose of permethrin. Contrary to what was 
      found in other insect species, no up-regulation was observed in the AnstABCB genes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time the involvement of ABC transporters 
      in larval defense against permethrin in An. stephensi and, more in general, confirm 
      the role of ABC transporters in insecticide defense. The differences observed with 
      previous studies highlight the need of further research as, despite the growing 
      number of studies on ABC transporters in insects, the heterogeneity of the results 
      available at present does not allow us to infer general trends in ABC 
      transporter-insecticide interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Discovery and development of novel drugs that are capable of overcoming 
      drug resistance in tumor cells are urgently needed clinically. In this study, we 
      sought to explore whether ivermectin (IVM), a macrolide antiparasitic agent, could 
      overcome the resistance of cancer cells to the therapeutic drugs. METHODS: We used 
      two solid tumor cell lines (HCT-8 colorectal cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer 
      cells) and one hematologic tumor cell line (K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells), 
      which are resistant to the chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and adriamycin 
      respectively, and two xenograft mice models, including the solid tumor model in nude 
      mice with the resistant HCT-8 cells and the leukemia model in NOD/SCID mice with the 
      resistant K562 cells to investigate the reversal effect of IVM on the resistance in 
      vitro and in vivo. MTT assay was used to investigate the effect of IVM on cancer 
      cells growth in vitro. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence 
      were performed to investigate the reversal effect of IVM in vivo. Western blotting, 
      qPCR, luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay were used to detect the molecular 
      mechanism of the reversal effect. Octet RED96 system and Co-IP were used to 
      determine the interactions between IVM and EGFR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that 
      ivermectin at its very low dose, which did not induce obvious cytotoxicity, 
      drastically reversed the resistance of the tumor cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs 
      both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ivermectin reversed the resistance 
      mainly by reducing the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) via inhibiting the 
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), not by directly inhibiting P-gp activity. 
      Ivermectin bound with the extracellular domain of EGFR, which inhibited the 
      activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling cascade ERK/Akt/NF-κB. The 
      inhibition of the transcriptional factor NF-κB led to the reduced P-gp 
      transcription. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that ivermectin 
      significantly enhanced the anti-cancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor 
      cells, especially in the drug-resistant cells. Thus, ivermectin, a FDA-approved 
      antiparasitic drug, could potentially be used in combination with chemotherapeutic 
      agents to treat cancers and in particular, the drug-resistant cancers.

AB  - Avoiding the toxic effects of ammonia derived from catabolism of proteins and 
      nucleic acids typically involves synthesis of the less soluble compound uric acid in 
      insects, although some species which are not water stressed excrete ammonia 
      directly. Some dipterans metabolize uric acid further to allantoin or urea. Uric 
      acid plays diverse roles as a nitrogenous waste, nitrogen store, pigment, 
      antioxidant and possibly a signaling molecule. Multiple transporters are implicated 
      in urate transport, including members of the ABC and SLC families. Excretion of 
      ammonia by the Malpighian tubules, hindgut, or anal papillae involves multiple 
      transporters, including Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, Rhesus glycoproteins, ammonia 
      transporters (AMTs) and possibly a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic 
      nucleotide-gated K(+) channel (HCN).

PG  - 546-557

AB  - Tissue integrity is contingent on maintaining stem cells. Intestinal stem cells 
      (ISCs) over-proliferate during ageing, leading to tissue dysplasia in Drosophila 
      melanogaster. Here we describe a role for white, encoding the evolutionarily 
      conserved ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily G, with a particularly 
      well-characterized role in eye colour pigmentation, in ageing-induced ISC 
      proliferation in the midgut. ISCs increase expression of white during ageing. 
      ISC-specific inhibition of white suppresses ageing-induced ISC dysregulation and 
      prolongs lifespan. Of the proteins that form heterodimers with White, Brown mediates 
      ISC dysregulation during ageing. Metabolomics analyses reveal previously 
      unappreciated, profound metabolic impacts of white inhibition on organismal 
      metabolism. Among the metabolites affected by White, tetrahydrofolate is transported 
      by White, is accumulated in ISCs during ageing and is indispensable for 
      ageing-induced ISC over-proliferation. Since Thomas Morgan's isolation of a white 
      mutant as the first Drosophila mutant, white mutants have been used extensively as 
      genetic systems and often as controls. Our findings provide insights into metabolic 
      regulation of stem cells mediated by the classic gene white.

AB  - Insects have evolved resistance to almost all insecticides developed for their 
      control. Multiple mechanisms of resistance, including enhanced metabolism and 
      excretion of insecticides, target-site insensitivity, reduced penetration of 
      insecticides, and avoidance behavior, have been reported. The genes coding for 
      proteins involved in resistance have been identified in numerous insects. The 
      enzymes and transporters required for all three phases of insecticide metabolism and 
      excretion including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, 
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, carboxylesterases, and ATP-binding cassette 
      transmembrane transporters have been identified. Recent research in multiple insect 
      species identified CNC-bZIP transcription factor superfamily members as regulators

AB  - BACKGROUND: ABC transporter superfamily is one of the largest and ubiquitous groups 
      of proteins. Because of their role in detoxification, insect ABC transporters have 
      gained more attention in recent years. In this study, we annotated ABC transporters 
      from a newly sequenced sweetpotato whitefly genome. Bemisia tabaci Q biotype is an 
      emerging global invasive species that has caused extensive damages to field crops as 
      well as ornamental plants. RESULTS: A total of 55 ABC transporters containing all 
      eight described subfamilies (A to H) were identified in the B. tabaci Q genome, 
      including 8 ABCAs, 3 ABCBs, 6 ABCCs, 2 ABCDs, 1 ABCE, 3 ABCFs, 23 ABCGs and 9 ABCHs. 
      In comparison to other species, subfamilies G and H in both phloem- and 
      blood-sucking arthropods are expanded. The temporal expression profiles of these 55 
      ABC transporters throughout B. tabaci developmental stages and their responses to 
      imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, were investigated using RNA-seq analysis. 
      Furthermore, the mRNA expression of 24 ABC transporters (44% of the total) 
      representing all eight subfamilies was confirmed by the quantitative real-time PCR 
      (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, mRNA expression levels estimated by RT-qPCR and RNA-seq 
      analyses were significantly correlated (r = 0.684, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It is the 
      first genome-wide analysis of the entire repertoire of ABC transporters in B. 
      tabaci. The identification of these ABC transporters, their temporal expression 
      profiles during B. tabaci development, and their response to a neonicotinoid 
      insecticide lay the foundation for functional genomic understanding of their 
      contribution to the invasiveness of B. tabaci.

TI  - Tissue-specific transcript profiling for ABC transporters in the sequestering larvae 
      of the phytophagous leaf beetle Chrysomela populi.
PG  - e98637
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0098637 [doi]
LID - e98637
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insects evolved ingenious adaptations to use extraordinary food sources. 
      Particularly, the diet of herbivores enriched with noxious plant secondary 
      metabolites requires detoxification mechanisms. Sequestration, which involves the 
      uptake, transfer, and concentration of occasionally modified phytochemicals into 
      specialized tissues or hemolymph, is one of the most successful detoxification 
      strategies found in most insect orders. Due to the ability of ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) carriers to transport a wide range of molecules including phytochemicals and 
      xenobiotics, it is highly likely that they play a role in this sequestration 
      process. To shed light on the role of ABC proteins in sequestration, we describe an 
      inventory of putative ABC transporters in various tissues in the sequestering 
      juvenile poplar leaf beetle, Chrysomela populi. RESULTS: In the transcriptome of C. 
      populi, we predicted 65 ABC transporters. To link the proteins with a possible 
      function, we performed comparative phylogenetic analyses with ABC transporters of 
      other insects and of humans. While tissue-specific profiling of each ABC transporter 
      subfamily suggests that ABCB, C and G influence the plant metabolite absorption in 
      the gut, ABCC with 14 members is the preferred subfamily responsible for the 
      excretion of these metabolites via Malpighian tubules. Moreover, salicin, which is 
      sequestered from poplar plants, is translocated into the defensive glands for 
      further deterrent production. In these glands and among all identified ABC 
      transporters, an exceptionally high transcript level was observed only for Cpabc35 
      (Cpmrp). RNAi revealed the deficiency of other ABC pumps to compensate the function 
      of CpABC35, demonstrating its key role during sequestration. CONCLUSION: We provide 
      the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of the ABC family in a phytophagous 
      beetle species. RNA-seq data from different larval tissues propose the importance of 
      ABC pumps to achieve a homeostasis of plant-derived compounds and offer a basis for 
      future analyses of their physiological function in sequestration processes.

TI  - Function and Role of ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters as Receptors for 3D-Cry 
      Toxins.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11020124 [doi]
LID - 124
AB  - When ABC transporter family C2 (ABCC2) and ABC transporter family B1 (ABCB1) were 
      heterologously expressed in non-susceptible cultured cells, the cells swelled in 
      response to Cry1A and Cry3 toxins, respectively. Consistent with the notion that 
      3D-Cry toxins form cation-permeable pores, Bombyx mori ABCC2 (BmABCC2) facilitated 
      cation-permeable pore formation by Cry1A when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. 
      Furthermore, BmABCC2 had a high binding affinity (K(D)) to Cry1Aa of 3.1 × 10(-10) 
      M. These findings suggest that ABC transporters, including ABCC2 and ABCB1, are 
      functional receptors for 3D-Cry toxins. In addition, the Cry2 toxins most distant 
      from Cry1A toxins on the phylogenetic tree used ABC transporter A2 as a receptor. 
      These data suggest that 3D-Cry toxins use ABC transporters as receptors. In terms of 
      inducing cell swelling, ABCC2 has greater activity than cadherin-like receptor. The 
      pore opening of ABC transporters was hypothesized to be linked to their receptor 
      function, but this was repudiated by experiments using mutants deficient in export 
      activity. The synergistic relationship between ABCC2 and cadherin-like receptor 
      explains their ability to cause resistance in one species of insect.

AB  - Characteristics of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been 
      well-described, but the genetic basis of male-female copulation is largely unknown. 
      Here we show that the white (w) gene, a classical gene for eye color, is associated 
      with copulation success. 82.5% of wild-type Canton-S flies copulated within 
      60 minutes in circular arenas, whereas few white-eyed mutants mated successfully. 
      The w (+) allele exchanged to the X chromosome or duplicated to the Y chromosome in 
      the white-eyed genetic background rescued the defect of copulation success. The w 
      (+)-associated copulation success was independent of eye color phenotype. Addition 
      of the mini-white (mw (+)) gene to the white-eyed mutant rescued the defect of 
      copulation success in a manner that was mw (+) copy number-dependent. Lastly, 
      male-female sexual experience mimicked the effects of w (+)/mw (+) in improving 
      successful copulation. These data suggest that the w (+) gene controls copulation 
      success in Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a large superfamily of proteins that 
      mediate diverse physiological functions by coupling ATP hydrolysis with substrate 
      transport across lipid membranes. In insects, these proteins play roles in 
      metabolism, development, eye pigmentation, and xenobiotic clearance. While ABC 
      transporters have been extensively studied in vertebrates, less is known concerning 
      this superfamily in insects, particularly hemipteran pests. We used RNA-Seq 
      transcriptome sequencing to identify 65 putative ABC transporter sequences 
      (including 36 full-length sequences) from the eight ABC subfamilies in the western 
      tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus), a polyphagous agricultural pest. Phylogenetic 
      analyses revealed clear orthologous relationships with ABC transporters linked to 
      insecticide/xenobiotic clearance and indicated lineage specific expansion of the L. 
      hesperus ABCG and ABCH subfamilies. The transcriptional profile of 13 LhABCs 
      representative of the ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, ABCG, and ABCH subfamilies was examined 
      across L. hesperus development and within sex-specific adult tissues. All of the 
      transcripts were amplified from both reproductively immature and mature adults and 
      all but LhABCA8 were expressed to some degree in eggs. Expression of LhABCA8 was 
      spatially localized to the testis and temporally timed with male reproductive 
      development, suggesting a potential role in sexual maturation and/or spermatozoa 
      protection. Elevated expression of LhABCC5 in Malpighian tubules suggests a possible 
      role in xenobiotic clearance. Our results provide the first transcriptome-wide 
      analysis of ABC transporters in an agriculturally important hemipteran pest and, 
      because ABC transporters are known to be important mediators of insecticidal 
      resistance, will provide the basis for future biochemical and toxicological studies 
      on the role of this protein family in insecticide resistance in Lygus species.

AB  - The brown planthopper ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins White (W), Scarlet (St) 
      and Brown (Bw) belong to the ABC transporter superfamily and are responsible for the 
      transportation of guanine and tryptophan precursors of eye pigments. In the present 
      study, the brown planthopper White (NlW), S t(NlSt) and Bw (NlBw) genes were cloned, 
      and subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that these genes are clustered with 
      their respective homologues, with a genetic relationship observed between NlW and 
      its Bemisia tabaci homologue having the highest similarity. Sequence alignments 
      showed that these three proteins have a highly conserved Walker A domain, an ABC 
      "signature sequence" and a Walker B domain. QRT-PCR demonstrated that W, St and Bw 
      are highly expressed in the head of long-winged males and are highly expressed in 
      both egg and male. Adult eye colour was altered after the downregulation of NlW, 
      NlSt and NlBw in the 1st to 3rd instar nymph. The eye colours of emerged adults 
      became white, dark and red after injection of dsNlW, dsNlSt and dsNlBw, 
      respectively. The eye pigment content assay revealed that xanthommatin and pteridine 
      were significantly decreased after the injection of dsRNAs, and the range of 
      variation was inversely correlated with nymph age. The present study provides a 
      theoretical basis for understanding the function of ABC transporters at the 
      molecular and biochemical levels.

AB  - In this article, we review the latest works on the insecticidal mechanisms of 
      Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins and the resistance mechanisms of insects against 
      Cry toxins. Currently, there are two models of insecticidal mechanisms for Cry 
      toxins, namely, the sequential binding model and the signaling pathway model. In the 
      sequential binding model, Cry toxins are activated to bind to their cognate 
      receptors in the mid-intestinal epithelial cell membrane, such as the 
      glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aminopeptidases-N (APNs), alkaline 
      phosphatases (ALPs), cadherins, and ABC transporters, to form pores that elicit cell 
      lysis, while in the signaling pathway model, the activated Cry toxins first bind to 
      the cadherin receptor, triggering an extensive cell signaling cascade to induce cell 
      apoptosis. However, these two models cannot seem to fully describe the complexity of 
      the insecticidal process of Cry toxins, and new models are required. Regarding the 
      resistance mechanism against Cry toxins, the main method insects employed is to 
      reduce the effective binding of Cry toxins to their cognate cell membrane receptors 
      by gene mutations, or to reduce the expression levels of the corresponding receptors 
      by trans-regulation. Moreover, the epigenetic mechanisms, host intestinal 
      microbiota, and detoxification enzymes also play significant roles in the insects' 
      resistance against Cry toxins. Today, high-throughput sequencing technologies like 
      transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics are powerful weapons for studying the 
      insecticidal mechanisms of Cry toxins and the resistance mechanisms of insects. We 
      believe that this review shall shed some light on the interactions between Cry 
      toxins and insects, which can further facilitate the development and utilization of 
      Cry toxins.

AB  - About a 100 years ago, the Drosophila white mutant marked the birth of Drosophila 
      genetics. The white gene turned out to encode the first well studied ABC transporter 
      in arthropods. The ABC gene family is now recognized as one of the largest 
      transporter families in all kingdoms of life. The majority of ABC proteins function 
      as primary-active transporters that bind and hydrolyze ATP while transporting a 
      large diversity of substrates across lipid membranes. Although extremely well 
      studied in vertebrates for their role in drug resistance, less is known about the 
      role of this family in the transport of endogenous and exogenous substances in 
      arthropods. The ABC families of five insect species, a crustacean and a chelicerate 
      have been annotated in some detail. We conducted a thorough phylogenetic analysis of 
      the seven arthropod and human ABC protein subfamilies, to infer orthologous 
      relationships that might suggest conserved function. Most orthologous relationships 
      were found in the ABCB half transporter, ABCD, ABCE and ABCF subfamilies, but 
      specific expansions within species and lineages are frequently observed and 
      discussed. We next surveyed the role of ABC transporters in the transport of 
      xenobiotics/plant allelochemicals and their involvement in insecticide resistance. 
      The involvement of ABC transporters in xenobiotic resistance in arthropods is 
      historically not well documented, but an increasing number of studies using unbiased 
      differential gene expression analysis now points to their importance. We give an 
      overview of methods that can be used to link ABC transporters to resistance. ABC 
      proteins have also recently been implicated in the mode of action and resistance to 
      Bt toxins in Lepidoptera. Given the enormous interest in Bt toxicology in transgenic 
      crops, such findings will provide an impetus to further reveal the role of ABC 
      transporters in arthropods.

AB  - ABC transporters have a well-established role in drug resistance, effluxing 
      xenobiotics from cells and tissues within the organism. More recently, research has 
      been dedicated to understanding the role insect ABC transporters play in insecticide 
      toxicity, but progress in understanding the contribution of specific transporters 
      has been hampered by the lack of functional genetic tools. Here, we report knockouts 
      of three Drosophila melanogaster ABC transporter genes, Mdr49, Mdr50, and Mdr65, 
      that are homologous to the well-studied mammalian ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein). Each 
      knockout mutant was created in the same wild type background and tested against a 
      panel of insecticides representing different chemical classes. Mdr65 knockouts were 
      more susceptible to all neuroactive insecticides tested, but Mdr49 and Mdr50 
      knockouts showed increased susceptibility or resistance depending on the insecticide 
      used. Mdr65 was chosen for further analysis. Calculation of LC(50) values for the 
      Mdr65 knockout allowed the substrate specificity of this transporter to be examined. 
      No obvious distinguishing structural features were shared among MDR65 substrates. A 
      role for Mdr65 in insecticide transport was confirmed by testing the capacity of the 
      knockout to synergize with the ABC inhibitor verapamil and by measuring the levels 
      of insecticide retained in the body of knockout flies. These data unambiguously 
      establish the influence of ABC transporters on the capacity of wild type 
      D. melanogaster to tolerate insecticide exposure and suggest that both tissue and 
      substrate specificity underpin this capacity.

      thuringiensis Cry1 toxins to the invasive crop-pest Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. 
      Smith).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda is a major agricultural pest 
      that has invaded the East Hemisphere since 2016, generating a serious threat to food 
      security worldwide including Africa and Asia. The Cry toxins produced by Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) have been shown to be effective against this insect pest. In 
      different insect ABC transporters (ABCC2 or ABCC3) have been shown to be involved as 
      receptors of some Cry1 toxins. Here we analyzed the role of SfABCC2 and SfABCC3 in 
      the toxicity of Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab toxins in this insect pest. RESULTS: Two S. 
      frugiperda SfABCC2 and SfABCC3 knockout strains, coding for potential functional Bt 
      receptors, were created using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. Both knockout 
      strains showed resistance to both Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab toxins compared with the 
      susceptible strain. SfABCC2 knockout strain showed higher resistance to both Cry 
      toxins than SfABCC3 knockout strain, suggesting a major role of SfABCC2 in the mode 
      of action of these Cry toxins. In addition, expression of SfABCC2 and SfABCC3 genes 
      in Trichoplusia ni Hi5 cells also increased the susceptibility to Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa 
      toxins, in agreement with the genome editing results. The double knockout of SfABCC2 
      and SfABCC3 strain was not viable in contrast to other lepidopteran species. 
      Furthermore, we report here that SfABCC2 or SfABCC3 knockout strains increased their 
      susceptibility to abamectin and spinosad insecticides. CONCLUSION: We provide 
      functional evidence that in S. frugiperda these two ABCC transporters serve as 
      receptors of Bt Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab toxins. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - A versatile contribution of both aminopeptidases N and ABC transporters to Bt Cry1Ac 
      toxicity in the diamondback moth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biopesticides and transgenic crops based on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 
      toxins are extensively used to control insect pests, but the rapid evolution of 
      insect resistance seriously threatens their effectiveness. Bt resistance is often 
      polygenic and complex. Mutations that confer resistance occur in midgut proteins 
      that act as cell surface receptors for the toxin, and it is thought they facilitate 
      its assembly as a membrane-damaging pore. However, the mechanistic details of the 
      action of Bt toxins remain controversial. RESULTS: We have examined the contribution 
      of two paralogous ABC transporters and two aminopeptidases N to Bt Cry1Ac toxicity 
      in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a series 
      of homozygous polygenic knockout strains. A double-gene knockout strain, in which 
      the two paralogous ABC transporters ABCC2 and ABCC3 were deleted, exhibited 
      4482-fold resistance to Cry1A toxin, significantly greater than that previously 
      reported for single-gene knockouts and confirming the mutual functional redundancy 
      of these ABC transporters in acting as toxin receptors in P. xylostella. A 
      double-gene knockout strain in which APN1 and APN3a were deleted exhibited 1425-fold 
      resistance to Cry1Ac toxin, providing the most direct evidence to date for these APN 
      proteins acting as Cry1Ac toxin receptors, while also indicating their functional 
      redundancy. Genetic crosses of the two double-gene knockouts yielded a hybrid strain 
      in which all four receptor genes were deleted and this resulted in a > 34,000-fold 
      resistance, indicating that while both types of receptor need to be present for the 
      toxin to be fully effective, there is a level of functional redundancy between them. 
      The highly resistant quadruple knockout strain was less fit than wild-type moths, 
      but no fitness cost was detected in the double knockout strains. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results provide direct evidence that APN1 and APN3a are important for Cry1Ac 
      toxicity. They support our overarching hypothesis of a versatile mode of action of 
      Bt toxins, which can compensate for the absence of individual receptors, and are 
      consistent with an interplay among diverse midgut receptors in the toxins' mechanism 
      of action in a super pest.

TI  - Resistance in the Genus Spodoptera: Key Insect Detoxification Genes.
LID - 10.3390/insects12060544 [doi]
LID - 544
AB  - The genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) includes species that are among the 
      most important crop pests in the world. These polyphagous species are able to feed 
      on many plants, including corn, rice and cotton. In addition to their ability to 
      adapt to toxic compounds produced by plants, they have developed resistance to the 
      chemical insecticides used for their control. One of the main mechanisms developed 
      by insects to become resistant involves detoxification enzymes. In this review, we 
      illustrate some examples of the role of major families of detoxification enzymes 
      such as cytochromes P450, carboxyl/cholinesterases, glutathione S-transferases (GST) 
      and transporters such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in insecticide 
      resistance. We compare available data for four species, Spodoptera exigua, S. 
      frugiperda, S. littoralis and S. litura. Molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      involvement of these genes in resistance will be described, including the 
      duplication of the CYP9A cluster, over-expression of GST epsilon or point mutations 
      in acetylcholinesterase and ABCC2. This review is not intended to be exhaustive but 
      to highlight the key roles of certain genes.

TI  - How do toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis kill insects? An evolutionary perspective.
PG  - e21673
LID - 10.1002/arch.21673 [doi]
AB  - Three-domain Cry toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are 
      increasingly used in agriculture to replace chemical insecticides in pest control. 
      Most chemical insecticides kill pest insects swiftly, but are also toxic to 
      beneficial insects and other species in the agroecosystem. Cry toxins enjoy the 
      advantages of high selectivity and the possibility of the application by sprays or 
      transgenic plants. However, these benefits are offset by the limited host range and 
      the evolution of resistance to Bt toxins by insect pests. Understanding how Bt 
      toxins kill insects will help to understand the nature of both problems. The recent 
      realization that ABC transporters play a central role in the killing mechanism will 
      play an important role in devising solutions.

TI  - Transcriptional plasticity of different ABC transporter genes from Tribolium 
      castaneum contributes to diflubenzuron resistance.

AB  - The development of insecticide resistance challenges the sustainability of pest 
      control and several studies have shown that ABC transporters contribute to this 
      process. ABC transporters are known to transport a large range of chemically diverse 
      molecules across cellular membranes, and therefore the identification of ABC 
      transporters involved in insecticide resistance is difficult. Here, we describe a 
      comprehensive strategy for the identification of whole sets of ABC transporters 
      involved in insecticide resistance using the pest beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Tc) 
      as a model. We analyzed the expression of ABCA to ABCC genes in different tissues 
      and developmental stages using larvae that were sensitive or resistant to 
      diflubenzuron (DFB). The mRNA levels of several ABC genes expressed in excretory or 
      metabolic tissues such as midgut, Malpighian tubules or fat body were markedly 
      upregulated in response to DFB. Next, we monitored mortality in the presence of the 
      ABC inhibitor verapamil, and found that it causes sensitization to DFB. We 
      furthermore established a competitive assay for the elimination of DFB, based on 
      Texas Red (TR) fluorescence. We monitored TR elimination in larvae that were treated 
      with DFB or different ABC inhibitors, and combinations of them. TR elimination was 
      decreased significantly in the presence of DFB, verapamil and the ABCC inhibitor 
      MK-571. The effect was synergized when DFB and verapamil were both present 
      suggesting that the transport of TR and DFB involves overlapping sets of ABC 
      transporters. Finally, we silenced the expression of DFB-responding ABC genes by RNA 
      interference and then followed the survival rates after DFB exposure. Mortality 
      increased particularly when specific ABCA and ABCC genes were silenced. Taken 
      together, we were able to show that different ABC transporters expressed in 
      metabolic and excretory tissues contribute to the elimination of DFB. Up- or 
      down-regulation of gene expression occurs within a few days already at very low DFB 
      concentrations. These results suggests that transcriptional plasticity of several 
      ABC genes allows adaptation of the efflux capacity in different tissues to eliminate 
      insecticides and/or their metabolites.

AB  - Intense use of insecticides has resulted in the selection of extreme levels of 
      resistance in insect populations. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of 
      insecticide resistance mechanisms becomes critical. Penetration resistance refers to 
      modifications in the cuticle that will eventually slow down the penetration of 
      insecticide molecules within insects' body. So far, two mechanisms of penetration 
      resistance have been described, the cuticle thickening and the altering of cuticle 
      composition. Cuticular modifications are attributed to the over-expression of 
      diversified genes or proteins, which belong to structural components (cuticular 
      proteins mainly), enzymes that catalyze enzymatic reactions (CYP4G16 and laccase 2) 
      or ABC transporters that promote cuticular translocation. In the present review we 
      summarize recent studies and discuss future perspectives.

AB  - When any living organism is frequently exposed to any drugs or toxic substances, 
      they evolve different detoxification mechanism to confront with toxicants during 
      absorption and metabolism. Likewise, the insects have evolved detoxification 
      mechanisms as they are frequently exposed to different toxic secondary plant 
      metabolites and commercial insecticides. ABC transporter superfamily is one of the 
      largest and ubiquitous group of proteins which play an important role in phase III 
      of the detoxification process. However, knowledge about this gene family remains 
      largely unknown. To help fill this gap, we have identified a total of 54 ABC 
      transporters in the Helicoverpa armigera genome which are classified into eight 
      subfamilies (A-H) by phylogenetic analysis. The temporal and spatial expression 
      profiles of these 54 ABC transporters throughout H. armigera development stages and 
      seven tissues and their responses to five different insecticides, were investigated 
      using RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of eight selected genes in 
      different tissues and six genes responses to insecticides were confirmed by the 
      quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, H. armigera become more sensitive to 
      abamectin and indoxacarb when P-gp was inhibited. These results provide a foundation 
      for further studies of ABCs in H. armigera.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily is one of the largest groups 
      of proteins and plays a non-negligible role in phase III of the detoxification 
      process, which is highly involved in the response of insects to environmental stress 
      (plant secondary metabolites and insecticides). In the present study, in Nilaparvata 
      lugens, we identified 32 ABC transporters, which are grouped into eight subfamilies 
      (ABCA-H) based on phylogenetic analysis. The temporal and spatial expression 
      profiles suggested that the nymphal stages (1st-5th) and adult males showed 
      similarity, which was different from eggs and adult females, and NlABCA1, NlABCA2, 
      NlABCB6, NlABCD2, NlABCG4, NlABCG12, NlABCG15, and NlABCH1 were highly expressed in 
      the midgut and Malpighian tubules. In addition, ABCG12, which belongs to the ABC 
      transporter G subfamily, was significantly upregulated after exposure to 
      sulfoxaflor, nitenpyram, clothianidin, etofenprox, chlorpyrifos, and isoprocarb. 
      Moreover, verapamil significantly increased the sensitivity of N. lugens to 
      nitenpyram, clothianidin, etofenprox, chlorpyrifos, and isoprocarb. These results 
      provide a basis for further research on ABC transporters involved in detoxification 
      in N. lugens, and for a more comprehensive understanding of the response of N. 
      lugens to environmental stress.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent the largest known group of efflux 
      pumps, utilizing ATP to translocate a broad spectrum of substrates across lipid 
      membranes, which play an important role in phase III of the detoxification process. 
      The presence of ABC transporters and their potential association with insecticide 
      resistance have not been investigated in Aphis gossypii, one of the most 
      economically important agricultural pests worldwide. In this study, the ABC 
      transporter inhibitor-verapamil significantly increased thiamethoxam toxicity 
      against resistant cotton aphids, suggesting that ABCs are involved in thiamethoxam 
      resistance. ABC transporter genes were identified using the A. gossypii genome 
      database and transcriptome data. A total of 69 ABC transporters were identified and 
      grouped into seven subfamilies (A-G), including 4 ABCAs, 5 ABCBs, 25 ABCCs, 2 ABCDs, 
      1 ABCE, 4 ABCFs and 30 ABCGs. Of these ABC transporters, 53 were predicted to be 
      functional, 19 were full transporters, 30 were half-transporters and 4 had two NBDs. 
      Subfamilies C and G accounted for 77% (32 and 45%, respectively) of the genes. The 
      transcripts of 20 of 26 ABCs based on the transcriptome were upregulated, and ABCA1, 
      ABCA2, ABCB1, ABCB4, ABCB8, ABCD1, ABCD2, ABCE1, ABCF1, ABCF3, ABCG7, ABCG15, 
      ABCG17, ABCG24, ABCG27, ABCG30, MRP1, MRP7, MRP14 and MRP21 transcripts were 
      significantly increased in the thiamethoxan resistant strain compared to the 
      susceptible strain with qRT-PCR. The suppression of overexpressed ABCs (ABCA2, 
      ABCD1, ABCD2, ABCE1 and ABCG15) significantly increased the thiamethoxam sensitivity 
      of resistant aphids. These results suggest that ABC transporters might be involved 
      in thiamethoxam resistance in A. gossypii and will facilitate further work to 
      validate the functional roles of these ABCs in thiamethoxam resistance. These 
      results are useful for understanding the multiple resistance mechanisms of 
      thiamethoxam and the management of insecticide-resistant cotton aphids.

TI  - Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters associated with sulfoxaflor 
      resistance in Aphis gossypii glover.
PG  - 4064-4072
LID - 10.1002/ps.6431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide for controlling against Aphis gossypii 
      in the field. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to a large superfamily 
      of proteins and play an important role in the detoxification process. However, the 
      potential role of ABC transporters in sulfoxaflor resistance in A. gossypii is 
      unknown. RESULTS: In this study, an ABC transporter inhibitor, verapamil, 
      dramatically increased the toxicity of sulfoxaflor in the resistant population with 
      a synergistic ratio of 8.55. However, verapamil did not synergize sulfoxaflor 
      toxicity in the susceptible population. The contents of ABC transporters were 
      significantly increased in the Sul-R population. Based on RT-qPCR analysis, 10 of 23 
      ABC transcripts, ABCA1, ABCA2, ABCB1, ABCB5, ABCD1, ABCG7, ABCG16, ABCG26, ABCG27, 
      and MRP7, were up-regulated in the Sul-R population compared to the Sus population. 
      Meanwhile, inductive effects of ABCA1, ABCD1, ABCG7 and ABCG26 by sulfoxaflor were 
      found in A. gossypii. Furthermore, knockdown of ABCA1 and ABCD1 using RNAi 
      significantly increased the sulfoxaflor sensitivity in Sul-R aphids. CONCLUSION: 
      These results suggested that ABC transporters, especially the ABCA1 and ABCD1 genes, 
      might be related with sulfoxaflor resistance in A. gossypii. This study will promote 
      further work to validate the functional roles of these ABCs in sulfoxaflor 
      resistance and might be helpful for the management of sulfoxaflor-resistant A. 
      gossypii.

AB  - In the Leishmania lifecycle, the motile promastigote form is transmitted from the 
      sand fly vector to a mammalian host during a blood meal. Inside vertebrate host 
      macrophages, the parasites can differentiate into the amastigote form and multiply, 
      causing leishmaniasis, one of the most significant neglected tropical diseases. 
      Leishmania parasites face different conditions throughout their development inside 
      sand flies. Once in the mammalian host, the parasites have to overcome the 
      microbicide repertoire of the cells of the immune system to successfully establish 
      the infection. In this context, the expression of protein phosphatases is of 
      particular interest. Several members of the serine/threonine-specific protein 
      phosphatase (STP), protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and histidine acid 
      phosphatase (HAcP) families have been described in different Leishmania species. 
      Although their physiological roles have not been fully elucidated, many studies 
      suggest they have an involvement with parasite biology and pathogeny. Phosphatases 
      play a role in adaptation to nutrient starvation during parasite passage through the 
      sand fly midgut. They are also important to parasite virulence, mainly due to the 
      modulation of host cytokine production and impairment of the microbiocidal potential 
      of macrophages. Furthermore, recent whole-genome expression analyses have shown that 
      different phosphatases are upregulated in metacyclic promastigotes, the infective 
      form of the mammalian host. Leishmania phosphatases are also upregulated in 
      drug-resistant strains, probably due to the increase in drug efflux related to the 
      activation of ABC transporters. Throughout this review, we will describe the 
      physiological roles that have been attributed to Leishmania endogenous phosphatases, 
      including their involvement in the adaptation, survival, and proliferation of the 
      parasites inside their hosts.

AB  - Resistance evolution of target pests reduces efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry 
      toxins used in insect-pest control. Mutations in Cadherin (CAD) or ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporters genes are linked to Cry resistance in different pests. 
      Also, it has been shown that ABCC2 and CAD have synergistic interaction on Cry 
      toxicity when co-express in cell lines, which we confirmed here by Helicoverpa 
      armigera HaABCC2 and HaCAD expression in Hi5 cells. To confirm that CAD and ABC 
      transporters interact in vivo, we constructed nearly H. armigera isogenic lines such 
      as LFC2 and 96CAD strains, linked to HaABCC2 and HaCAD mutations that showed 512- 
      and 396-fold Cry1Ac resistance-ratios, respectively. Interestingly, Fusion-1 strain 
      linked to both HaABCC2 and HaCAD mutations, showed 6273-fold resistance-ratio, 
      significantly higher than the single mutant strains. To confirm the interaction of 
      HaABCC2 and CAD in Cry1Ac resistance, we analyzed the Cry1Ac susceptibility in 
      CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown strains, C2-KO (ABCC2-gene knockout-strain) and CAD-KO 
      (CAD-gene knockout-strain), that showed 112- and 531-fold Cry1Ac resistance-ratios, 
      respectively. However, the resistance-ratio of Fusion-2 strain obtained from 
      crossing C2-KO and CAD-KO strains, was only 816-fold. The analysis of HaABCC3 gene 
      transcript levels showed nearly 4-fold lower expression in LFC2 and Fusion-1 strains 
      compared to the susceptible strain, suggesting that additional mutations in these 
      strains resulted in low HaABCC3 expression, which contribute to their enhanced 
      Cry1Ac resistance. Our data show that the CAD and ABCC2/ABCC3 interact 
      synergistically to induce high Cry1Ac resistance in H. armigera. These results can 
      be helpful for Bt resistance monitoring and pest management.

AB  - Resistance mechanisms to synthetic insecticides often include point mutations and 
      increased expression of genes encoding detoxification enzymes. Since pyrethroids are 
      the main adulticides used against Aedes aegypti, which vectors pathogens such as 
      Zika virus, understanding resistance to this insecticide class is of significant 
      relevance. We focused on adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporters in the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico (PR) strain of Ae. aegypti. We 
      investigated the expression patterns of six ABC transporters previously 
      characterized as differentially expressed in insecticide-challenged mosquitoes, or 
      increased mRNA expression in pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti, by comparing PR to 
      the Rockefeller (Rock) susceptible strain. No constitutive differential expression 
      between strains was detected, but expression differences for these genes was 
      influenced by sex and age, suggesting that their role is independent from resistance 
      in PR. Instead, ABC transporters may be induced after insecticide exposure. 
      Challenging mosquitoes with deltamethrin, with or without ABC transporter 
      modulators, showed that Rock and PR responded differently, but a contribution of ABC 
      transporters to deltamethrin toxicity is suspected. Moreover, the effect of 
      dexamethasone, which enhanced the inhibition of nerve firing by deltamethrin, was 
      observed using a Drosophila central nervous system preparation, showing synergy of 
      these two compounds through the potential inhibition of ABC transporters.

AB  - Plants are master regulators of rhizosphere ecology, secreting a complex mixture of 
      compounds into the soil, collectively termed plant root exudate. Root exudate 
      composition is highly dynamic and functional, mediating economically important 
      interactions between plants and a wide range of soil organisms. Currently we know 
      very little about the molecular basis of root exudate composition, which is a key 
      hurdle to functional exploitation of root exudates for crop improvement. Root 
      expressed transporters modulate exudate composition and could be manipulated to 
      develop beneficial plant root exudate traits. Using Virus Induced Gene silencing 
      (VIGS), we demonstrate that knockdown of two root-expressed ABC transporter genes in 
      tomato cv. Moneymaker, ABC-C6 and ABC-G33, alters the composition of semi-volatile 
      compounds in collected root exudates. Root exudate chemotaxis assays demonstrate 
      that knockdown of each transporter gene triggers the repulsion of economically 
      relevant Meloidogyne and Globodera spp. plant parasitic nematodes, which are 
      attracted to control treatment root exudates. Knockdown of ABC-C6 inhibits egg 
      hatching of Meloidogyne and Globodera spp., relative to controls. Knockdown of 
      ABC-G33 has no impact on egg hatching of Meloidogyne spp. but has a substantial 
      inhibitory impact on egg hatching of G. pallida. ABC-C6 knockdown has no impact on 
      the attraction of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, or the plant growth 
      promoting Bacillus subtilis, relative to controls. Silencing ABC-G33 induces a 
      statistically significant reduction in attraction of B. subtilis, with no impact on 
      attraction of A. tumefaciens. By inoculating selected differentially exuded 
      compounds into control root exudates, we demonstrate that hexadecaonic acid and 
      pentadecane are biologically relevant parasite repellents. ABC-C6 represents a 
      promising target for breeding or biotechnology intervention strategies as gene 
      knockdown leads to the repulsion of economically important plant parasites and 
      retains attraction of the beneficial rhizobacterium B. subtilis. This study exposes 
      the link between ABC transporters, root exudate composition, and ex planta 
      interactions with agriculturally and economically relevant rhizosphere organisms, 
      paving the way for new approaches to rhizosphere engineering and crop protection.

AB  - Membrane proteins play important roles in health and disease. Despite their 
      importance, the study of membrane proteins has been significantly limited by the 
      difficulties inherent to their successful expression, purification, and 
      stabilization once they have been extracted from the cell membrane. In addition, 
      expression of human membrane proteins commonly requires the use of expensive and/or 
      time-consuming eukaryotic systems, hence their successful expression in bacteria 
      will be obviously beneficial for experimental research. Furthermore, since lipids 
      can have critical effects on the activity of membrane proteins and given the 
      composition similarities between the inner mitochondrial membrane and the bacterial 
      plasma membrane, production of mitochondrial membrane proteins in E. coli represents 
      a logical choice. Here, we present a novel protocol to produce a human mitochondrial 
      ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter in E. coli. The function of the three known 
      human mitochondrial ABC transporters is not fully understood, but X-ray 
      crystallography models of ABCB10 produced in insect cells are available. We have 
      successfully expressed and purified ABCB10 from E. coli. The yield is close to that 
      of another bacterial ABC transporter routinely produced in our laboratory under 
      similar conditions. In addition, we can efficiently reconstitute detergent purified 
      ABCB10 into lipid nanodiscs. Measurements of ATPase activity of ABCB10 produced in 
      E. coli show an ATP hydrolysis rate similar to other human ABC transporters. This 
      novel protocol facilitates the production of this human mitochondrial transporter 
      for biochemical, structural, and functional analysis, and can likely be adjusted for 
      production of other mitochondrial transporters.

AB  - Transport engineering in bioengineering is aimed at efficient export of the final 
      product to reduce toxicity and feedback inhibition and to increase yield. The 
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters with their highly diverse substrate 
      specificity and role in cellular efflux are potentially suitable in transport 
      engineering approaches, although their size and high number of introns make them 
      notoriously difficult to clone. Here, we report a novel in planta "exon engineering" 
      strategy for cloning of full-length coding sequence of ABC transporters followed by 
      methods for biochemical characterization of ABC exporters in Xenopus oocytes. 
      Although the Xenopus oocyte expression system is particularly suitable for 
      expression of membrane proteins and powerful in screening for novel transporter 
      activity, only few examples of successful expression of ABC transporter has been 
      reported. This raises the question whether the oocytes system is suitable to express 
      and characterize ABC transporters. Thus we have selected AtABCG25, previously 
      characterized in insect cells as the exporter of commercially valuable abscisic 
      acid-as case study for optimizing of characterization in Xenopus oocytes. The tools 
      provided will hopefully contribute to more successful transport engineering in 
      synthetic biology.

AB  - Polyphagous insect herbivores are adapted to many different secondary metabolites of 
      their host plants. However, little is known about the role of ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) transporters, a multigene family involved in detoxification processes. To 
      study the larval response of the generalist Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera) and 
      the putative role of ABC transporters, we performed developmental assays on 
      artificial diet supplemented with secondary metabolites from host plants 
      (atropine-scopolamine, nicotine and tomatine) and non-host plants (taxol) in 
      combination with a replicated RNAseq experiment. A maximum likelihood phylogeny 
      identified the subfamily affiliations of the ABC transporter sequences. Larval 
      performance was equal on the atropine-scopolamine diet and the tomatine diet. For 
      the latter we could identify a treatment-specific upregulation of five ABC 
      transporters in the gut. No significant developmental difference was detected 
      between larvae fed on nicotine or taxol. This was also mirrored in the upregulation 
      of five ABC transporters when fed on either of the two diets. The highest number of 
      differentially expressed genes was recorded in the gut samples in response to 
      feeding on secondary metabolites. Our results are consistent with the expectation of 
      a general detoxification response in a polyphagous herbivore. This is the first 
      study to characterize the multigene family of ABC transporters and identify gene 
      expression changes across different developmental stages and tissues, as well as the 
      impact of secondary metabolites in the agricultural pest H. armigera.

AB  - Arthropods have well adapted to the vast array of chemicals they encounter in their 
      environment. Whether these xenobiotics are plant allelochemicals or anthropogenic 
      insecticides one of the strategies they have developed to defend themselves is the 
      induction of detoxification enzymes. Although upregulation of detoxification enzymes 
      and efflux transporters in response to specific inducers has been well described, in 
      insects, yet, little is known on the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Over 
      the past twenty years, an increasing number of studies with insects have used 
      advanced genetic tools such as RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9 and reporter gene assays to dissect 
      the genomic grounds of their xenobiotic response and hence contributed substantially 
      in improving our knowledge on the players involved. Xenobiotics are partly 
      recognized by various "xenobiotic sensors" such as membrane-bound or nuclear 
      receptors. This initiates a molecular reaction cascade ultimately leading to the 
      translocation of a transcription factor to the nucleus that recognizes and binds to 
      short sequences located upstream their target genes to activate transcription. To 
      date, a number of signaling pathways were shown to mediate the upregulation of 
      detoxification enzymes in arthropods and to play a role in either metabolic 
      resistance to insecticides or host-plant adaptation. These include nuclear receptors 
      AhR/ARNT and HR96, GPCRs, CncC and MAPK/CREB. Recent work reveals that upregulation 
      and activation of some components of these pathways as well as polymorphism in the 
      binding motifs of transcription factors are linked to insects' adaptive processes. 
      The aim of this mini-review is to summarize and describe recent work that shed some 
      light on the main regulatory routes of detoxification gene expression in insects.

AB  - ABC transporters are ubiquitous membrane-bound proteins, present in both prokaryotes 
      and eukaryotes. The major function of eukaryotic ABC transporters is to mediate the 
      efflux of a variety of substrates (including xenobiotics) out of cells. ABC 
      transporters have been widely investigated in humans, particularly for their 
      involvement in multidrug resistance (MDR). Considerably less is known about their 
      roles in transport and/or excretion in insects. ABC transporters are only known to 
      function as exporters in insects. Drosophila melanogaster has 56 ABC transporter 
      genes, including eight which are phylogenetically most similar to the human Mdr 
      genes (ABCB1 clade). We investigated the role of ABC transporters in the ABCB1 clade 
      in modulating the susceptibility to insecticides. We took advantage of the GAL4/UAS 
      system in D. melanogaster to knockdown the expression levels of Mdr65, Mdr50, Mdr49 
      and ABCB6 using transgenic UAS-RNAi lines and conditional driver lines. The most 
      notable effects were increased sensitivities to nine different insecticides by 
      silencing of Mdr65. Furthermore, a null mutation of Mdr65 decreased the malathion, 
      malaoxon and fipronil LC(50) values by a factor of 1.9, 2.1 and 3.9, respectively. 
      Altogether, this data demonstrates the critical role of ABC transporters, 
      particularly Mdr65, in altering the toxicity of specific, structurally diverse, 
      insecticides in D. melanogaster.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insect body coloration often functions as camouflage to survive from 
      predators or mate selection. Transportation of pigment precursors or related 
      metabolites from cytoplasm to subcellular pigment granules is one of the key steps 
      in insect pigmentation and usually executed via such transporter proteins as the 
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane transporters and small G-proteins (e.g. Rab 
      protein). However, little is known about the copy numbers of pigment transporter 
      genes in the butterfly genomes and about the roles of pigment transporters in the 
      development of swallowtail butterflies. RESULTS: Here, we have identified 56 ABC 
      transporters and 58 Rab members in the genome of swallowtail butterfly Papilio 
      xuthus. This is the first case of genome-wide gene copy number identification of ABC 
      transporters in swallowtail butterflies and Rab family in lepidopteran insects. 
      Aiming to investigate the contribution of the five genes which are orthologous to 
      well-studied pigment transporters (ABCG: white, scarlet, brown and ok; Rab: 
      lightoid) of fruit fly or silkworm during the development of swallowtail 
      butterflies, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing of these genes using P. xuthus as 
      a model and sequenced the transcriptomes of their morphological mutants. Our results 
      indicate that the disruption of each gene produced mutated phenotypes in the colors 
      of larvae (cuticle, testis) and/or adult eyes in G0 individuals but have no effect 
      on wing color. The transcriptomic data demonstrated that mutations induced by 
      CRISPR/Cas9 can lead to the accumulation of abnormal transcripts and the decrease or 
      dosage compensation of normal transcripts at gene expression level. Comparative 
      transcriptomes revealed 606 ~ 772 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 
      mutants of four ABCG transporters and 1443 DEGs in the mutants of lightoid. GO and 
      KEGG enrichment analysis showed that DEGs in ABCG transporter mutants enriched to 
      the oxidoreductase activity, heme binding, iron ion binding process possibly related 
      to the color display, and DEGs in lightoid mutants are enriched in glycoprotein 
      binding and protein kinases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated these transporter 
      proteins play an important role in body color of P. xuthus. Our study provides new 
      insights into the function of ABC transporters and small G-proteins in the 
      morphological development of butterflies.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) genes encode the largest family of transmembrane 
      proteins. ABC transporters translocate a wide variety of substrates across 
      membranes, but their physiological function is often incompletely understood. We 
      describe a new method to study the substrate spectrum of ABC transporters: We 
      incubate extracts of mouse urine with membrane vesicles prepared from Spodoptera 
      frugiperda Sf9 insect cells overproducing an ABC transporter and determine the 
      compounds transported into the vesicles by LC/MS-based metabolomics. We illustrate 
      the power of this simple "transportomics" approach using ABCC2, a protein present at 
      sites of uptake and elimination. We identified many new substrates of ABCC2 in 
      urine. These included glucuronides of plant-derived xenobiotics, a class of 
      compounds to which humans are exposed on a daily basis. Moreover, we show that the 
      excretion of these compounds in vivo depends on ABCC2: compared to wild-type mice, 
      the urinary excretion of several glucuronides was increased up to 20-fold in 
      Abcc2(-/-) mice. Transportomics has broad applicability, as it is not restricted to 
      urine and can be applied to other ATP-dependent transport proteins as well.

AB  - Vacuole is a prominent organelle that often occupies most of the plant cell volume. 
      The vacuolar accumulation of secondary metabolites, also called specialized 
      metabolites, plays important roles in environmental responses such as protecting 
      against insect herbivores and attracting pollinators. The compartmentation of 
      xenobiotics in the vacuole is also essential for adaptation to environmental 
      stresses. These accumulations involve several transport systems, for which some 
      responsible transporter proteins have been reported. Furthermore, studies on 
      biosynthetic enzymes and transporters of secondary metabolites have revealed that 
      vacuoles, which have been recognized for many years as a site for accumulation, also 
      function as a site for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and are thus actively 
      involved in the entire biosynthetic process. In this review, we briefly summarize 
      recent findings on vacuolar transporters involved in secondary metabolites and 
      xenobiotics, and discuss their roles in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic 
      stresses, through vacuolar dynamism.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane-bound proteins involved in the 
      movement of various substrates, including drugs and insecticides, across the lipid 
      membrane. Demonstration of the role of human ABC transporters in multidrug 
      resistance has led to speculation that they might be an important mechanism 
      controlling the fate of insecticides in insects. However, the role of ABC 
      transporters in insects remains largely unknown. The small brown planthopper, 
      Laodelphax striatellus Fallén, has developed resistance to most of the insecticides 
      used for its control. Our goals were to identify the ABC transporters in La. 
      striatellus and to examine their involvement in resistance mechanisms, using related 
      strains resistant to chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin and imidacloprid, compared with the 
      susceptible strain. Based on the transcriptome of La. striatellus, 40 full-length 
      ABC transporters belonging to the ABCA-ABCH subfamilies were identified. 
      Quantitative PCR revealed that over 20% of genes were significantly up-regulated in 
      different resistant strains, and eight genes from the ABCB/C/D/G subfamilies were 
      up-regulated in all three resistant strains, compared with the susceptible strain. 
      Furthermore, synergism studies showed verapamil significantly enhanced insecticide 
      toxicity in various resistant strains but not in the susceptible strain. These 
      results suggest that ABC transporters might be involved in resistance to multiple 
      insecticides in La. striatellus.

TI  - Identification and transcriptional response of ATP-binding cassette transporters to 
      chlorantraniliprole in the rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis.
PG  - 3626-3635
LID - 10.1002/ps.5897 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the largest transporter gene family in metazoans, ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporters regulate the efflux of a broad spectrum of substrates 
      from the cytoplasm to the outside of the cell. In arthropods, ABC transporters are 
      involved in phase III of the detoxification process, and play important roles in the 
      metabolism and transport of insecticides. RESULTS: We identified 54 ABC transporters 
      from the genome and transcriptome of Chilo suppressalis, one of the most damaging 
      pests of rice in China. The identified ABC transporters were classified into eight 
      subfamilies (ABCA to ABCH) based on NCBI BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. Synergism 
      studies showed that treatment with verapamil, a potent inhibitor of ABC 
      transporters, resulted in significantly increased toxicity of chlorantraniliprole 
      against C. suppressalis larvae. Among the 21 tested ABC genes, three ABC transporter 
      genes including CsABCC8, CsABCG1C and CsABCH1 were significantly upregulated after 
      chlorantraniliprole treatment. CONCLUSION: ABC transporters play important roles in 
      the detoxification and transport of chlorantraniliprole in C. suppressalis. The 
      results from our study provide valuable information on C. suppressalis ABC 
      transporters, and are helpful in understanding the roles of ABC transporters in 
      chlorantraniliprole resistance mechanisms in C. suppressalis and other insect pests.

AB  - Transport proteins of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family are found in all 
      kingdoms of life. In humans, several ABC efflux transporters play a role in drug 
      disposition and excretion. Therefore, in vitro methods have been developed to 
      characterize the substrate and inhibitor properties of drugs with respect to these 
      transporters. In the vesicular transport assay, transport is studied using inverted 
      membrane vesicles produced from transporter overexpressing cell lines of both 
      mammalian and insect origin. Insect cell expression systems benefit from a higher 
      expression compared to background, but are not as well characterized as their 
      mammalian counterparts regarding endogenous transport. Therefore, the contribution 
      of this transport in the assay might be underappreciated. In this study, endogenous 
      transport in membrane vesicles from Spodoptera frugiperda -derived Sf9 cells was 
      characterized using four typical substrates of human ABC transporters: 
      5(6)-carboxy-2,'7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDCF), estradiol-17β-glucuronide, estrone 
      sulfate and N-methyl-quinidine. Significant ATP-dependent transport was observed for 
      three of the substrates with cholesterol-loading of the vesicles, which is sometimes 
      used to improve the activity of human transporters expressed in Sf9 cells. The 
      highest effect of cholesterol was on CDCF transport, and this transport in the 
      cholesterol-loaded Sf9 vesicles was time and concentration dependent with a K(m) of 
      8.06 ± 1.11 μM. The observed CDCF transport was inhibited by known inhibitors of 
      human ABCC transporters, but not by ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitors verapamil and Ko143, 
      respectively. Two candidate genes for ABCC-type transporters in the S. frugiperda 
      genome (SfABCC2 and SfABCC3) were identified based on sequence analysis as a 
      hypothesis to explain the observed endogenous ABCC-type transport in Sf9 vesicles. 
      Although further studies are needed to verify the role of SfABCC2 and SfABCC3 in Sf9 
      vesicles, the findings of this study highlight the need to carefully characterize 
      background transport in Sf9 derived membrane vesicles to avoid false positive 
      substrate findings for human ABC transporters studied with this overexpression 
      system.

AB  - Drug transport and drug-drug interactions (DDI) with human ABC transporters are 
      generally investigated in mammalian cell lines or inverted membrane vesicles from 
      insect cells (Sf9) overexpressing the transporter of interest. In this study, we 
      instead used membrane vesicles from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) 
      overexpressing wild type MDR1/Pgp (ABCB1), BCRP (ABCG2), and MRP2 (ABCC2) with the 
      aim to study the concentration dependent inhibition of shared and prototypic probe 
      substrates. We first investigated 15 substrates and identified 
      estrone-17-beta-glucorinide (E17G) as shared substrate. Nine specific and general 
      inhibitors were then studied using E17G and prototypic probe substrates. The results 
      were compared with those previously obtained in Sf9 vesicles and cell lines of 
      canine (MDCKII) and human (Saos-2) origin. For the majority of inhibitors, K(i) 
      values differed <10-fold between E17G and probe substrates. Significant differences 
      in K(i) values were observed for about one third of the inhibitors. The transport 
      inhibition potencies in HEK293 vesicles were in good agreement with those obtained 
      in Sf9 vesicles. Large differences were found in the inhibition potencies observed 
      in the vesicular systems compared to the cellular systems. Nevertheless, the rank 
      order correlations between the different experimental systems were generally good. 
      Our study provides further information on substrate dependent inhibition of 
      ABC-transporters, and suggests that simple ranking of compounds can be used as a 
      tier one approach to bridge results obtained in different experimental systems.

TI  - ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporter Genes Involved in Pyrethroid Resistance in 
      the Malaria Vector Anopheles sinensis: Genome-Wide Identification, Characteristics, 
      Phylogenetics, and Expression Profile.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20061409 [doi]
LID - 1409
AB  - background: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family is one of the largest 
      families of membrane proteins existing in all living organisms. Pyrethroid 
      resistance has become the largest unique obstacle for mosquito control worldwide. 
      ABC transporters are thought to be associated with pyrethroid resistance in some 
      agricultural pests, but little information is known for mosquitoes. Herein, we 
      investigated the diversity, location, characteristics, phylogenetics, and evolution 
      of ABC transporter family of genes in the Anopheles sinensis genome, and identified 
      the ABC transporter genes associated with pyrethroid resistance through expression 
      profiles using RNA-seq and qPCR. Results: 61 ABC transporter genes are identified 
      and divided into eight subfamilies (ABCA-H), located on 22 different scaffolds. 
      Phylogenetic and evolution analyses with ABC transporters of A. gambiae, Drosophila 
      melanogaster, and Homo sapiens suggest that the ABCD, ABCG, and ABCH subfamilies are 
      monophyly, and that the ABCC and ABCG subfamilies have experienced a gene 
      duplication event. Both RNA-seq and qPCR analyses show that the AsABCG28 gene is 
      uniquely significantly upregulated gene in all three field pyrethroid-resistant 
      populations (Anhui, Chongqing, and Yunnan provinces) in comparison with a 
      laboratory-susceptible strain from Jiangsu province. The AsABCG28 is significantly 
      upregulated at 12-h and 24-h after deltamethrin exposure in three-day-old female 
      adults. Conclusion: This study provides the information frame for ABC transporter 
      subfamily of genes, and lays an important basis for the better understanding and 
      further research of ABC transporter function in insecticide toxification. The 
      AsABCG28 gene is associated with pyrethroid detoxification, and it functions at 
      later period in the detoxification process for xenobiotics transportation.

TI  - ABC Transporter DerAB of Lactobacillus casei Mediates Resistance against 
      Insect-Derived Defensins.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00818-20 [doi]
LID - e00818-20
AB  - Bce-like systems mediate resistance against antimicrobial peptides in Firmicutes 
      bacteria. Lactobacillus casei BL23 encodes an "orphan" ABC transporter that, based 
      on homology to BceAB-like systems, was proposed to contribute to antimicrobial 
      peptide resistance. A mutant lacking the permease subunit was tested for sensitivity 
      against a collection of peptides derived from bacteria, fungi, insects, and humans. 
      Our results show that the transporter specifically conferred resistance against 
      insect-derived cysteine-stabilized αβ defensins, and it was therefore renamed DerAB 
      for defensin resistance ABC transporter. Surprisingly, cells lacking DerAB showed a 
      marked increase in resistance against the lantibiotic nisin. This could be explained 
      by significantly increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide resistance 
      determinants regulated by the Bce-like systems PsdRSAB (formerly module 09) and 
      ApsRSAB (formerly module 12). Bacterial two-hybrid studies in Escherichia coli 
      showed that DerB could interact with proteins of the sensory complex in the Psd 
      resistance system. We therefore propose that interaction of DerAB with this complex 
      in the cell creates signaling interference and reduces the cell's potential to mount 
      an effective nisin resistance response. In the absence of DerB, this negative 
      interference is relieved, leading to the observed hyperactivation of the Psd module 
      and thus increased resistance to nisin. Our results unravel the function of a 
      previously uncharacterized Bce-like orphan resistance transporter with pleiotropic 
      biological effects on the cell.IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an 
      important role in suppressing the growth of microorganisms. They can be produced by 
      bacteria themselves-to inhibit competitors-but are also widely distributed in higher 
      eukaryotes, including insects and mammals, where they form an important component of 
      innate immunity. In low-GC-content Gram-positive bacteria, BceAB-like transporters 
      play a crucial role in AMP resistance but have so far been primarily associated with 
      interbacterial competition. Here, we show that the orphan transporter DerAB from the 
      lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus casei is crucial for high-level resistance 
      against insect-derived AMPs. It therefore represents an important mechanism for 
      interkingdom defense. Furthermore, our results support a signaling interference from 
      DerAB on the PsdRSAB module that might prevent the activation of a full nisin 
      response. The Bce modules from L. casei BL23 illustrate a biological paradox in 
      which the intrinsic nisin detoxification potential only arises in the absence of a 
      defensin-specific ABC transporter.

AB  - Sequestration of plant secondary metabolites is a detoxification strategy widespread 
      in herbivorous insects including not only storage, but also usage of these 
      metabolites for the insects' own benefit. Larvae of the poplar leaf beetle 
      Chrysomela populi sequester plant-derived salicin to produce the deterrent 
      salicylaldehyde in specialized exocrine glands. To identify putative transporters 
      involved in the sequestration process we investigated integral membrane proteins of 
      several tissues from juvenile C. populi by using a proteomics approach. 
      Computational analyses led to the identification of 122 transport proteins in the 
      gut, 105 in the Malpighian tubules, 94 in the fat body and 27 in the defensive 
      glands. Among these, primary active transporters as well as electrochemical 
      potential-driven transporters were most abundant in all tissues, including ABC 
      transporters (especially subfamilies B, C and G) and sugar porters as most 
      interesting families facilitating the sequestration of plant glycosides. Whereas ABC 
      transporters are predominantly expressed simultaneously in several tissues, sugar 
      porters are often expressed in only one tissue, suggesting that sugar porters govern 
      more distinct functions than members of the ABC family. The inventory of 
      transporters presented in this study provides the base for further functional 
      characterizations on transport processes of sequestered glycosides in insects.

TI  - Identification and Expression Characterization of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) 
      Transporter Genes in Melon Fly.
LID - 10.3390/insects12030270 [doi]
LID - 270
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter is a protein superfamily that transports 
      specific substrate molecules across lipid membranes in all living species. In 
      insects, ABC transporter is one of the major transmembrane protein families involved 
      in the development of xenobiotic resistance. Here, we report 49 ABC transporter 
      genes divided into eight subfamilies (ABCA-ABCH), including seven ABCAs, seven 
      ABCBs, 10 ABCCs, two ABCDs, one ABCE, three ABCFs, 16 ABCGs, and three ABCHs 
      according to phylogenetic analysis in Zeugodacus cucurbitae, a highly destructive 
      insect pest of cucurbitaceous and other related crops. The expressions level of 49 
      ABC transporters throughout various developmental stages and within different 
      tissues were evaluated by quantitative transcriptomic analysis, and their 
      expressions in response to three different insecticides were evaluated by 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These ABC transporter 
      genes were widely expressed at developmental stages but most highly expressed in 
      tissues of the midgut, fat body and Malpighian tube. When challenged by exposure to 
      three insecticides, abamectin, β-cypermethrin, and dinotefuran, the expressions of 
      ZcABCB7 and ZcABCC2 were significantly up-regulated. ZcABCB1, ZcABCB6, ZcABCB7, 
      ZcABCC2, ZcABCC3, ZcABCC4, ZcABCC5, and ZcABCC7 were significantly up-regulated in 
      the fat body at 24 h after β-cypermethrin exposure. These data suggest that ZcABCB7 
      and ZcABCC2 might play key roles in xenobiotic metabolism in Z. cucurbitae. 
      Collectively, these data provide a foundation for further analysis of ABCs in Z. 
      cucurbitae.

TI  - A burst of ABC genes in the genome of the polyphagous spider mite Tetranychus 
      urticae.
PG  - 317
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-14-317 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ABC (ATP-binding cassette) gene superfamily is widespread across all 
      living species. The majority of ABC genes encode ABC transporters, which are 
      membrane-spanning proteins capable of transferring substrates across biological 
      membranes by hydrolyzing ATP. Although ABC transporters have often been associated 
      with resistance to drugs and toxic compounds, within the Arthropoda ABC gene 
      families have only been characterized in detail in several insects and a crustacean. 
      In this study, we report a genome-wide survey and expression analysis of the ABC 
      gene superfamily in the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a chelicerate ~ 450 
      million years diverged from other Arthropod lineages. T. urticae is a major 
      agricultural pest, and is among of the most polyphagous arthropod herbivores known. 
      The species resists a staggering array of toxic plant secondary metabolites, and has 
      developed resistance to all major classes of pesticides in use for its control. 
      RESULTS: We identified 103 ABC genes in the T. urticae genome, the highest number 
      discovered in a metazoan species to date. Within the T. urticae ABC gene set, all 
      members of the eight currently described subfamilies (A to H) were detected. A 
      phylogenetic analysis revealed that the high number of ABC genes in T. urticae is 
      due primarily to lineage-specific expansions of ABC genes within the ABCC, ABCG and 
      ABCH subfamilies. In particular, the ABCC subfamily harbors the highest number of T. 
      urticae ABC genes (39). In a comparative genomic analysis, we found clear 
      orthologous relationships between a subset of T. urticae ABC proteins and ABC 
      proteins in both vertebrates and invertebrates known to be involved in fundamental 
      cellular processes. These included members of the ABCB-half transporters, and the 
      ABCD, ABCE and ABCF families. Furthermore, one-to-one orthologues could be 
      distinguished between T. urticae proteins and human ABCC10, ABCG5 and ABCG8, the 
      Drosophila melanogaster sulfonylurea receptor and ecdysone-regulated transporter 
      E23. Finally, expression profiling revealed that ABC genes in the ABCC, ABCG ABCH 
      subfamilies were differentially expressed in multi-pesticide resistant mite strains 
      and/or in mites transferred to challenging (toxic) host plants. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      study we present the first comprehensive analysis of ABC genes in a polyphagous 
      arthropod herbivore. We demonstrate that the broad plant host range and high levels 
      of pesticide resistance in T. urticae are associated with lineage-specific 
      expansions of ABC genes, many of which respond transcriptionally to xenobiotic 
      exposure. This ABC catalogue will serve as a basis for future biochemical and 
      toxicological studies. Obtaining functional evidence that these ABC subfamilies 
      contribute to xenobiotic tolerance should be the priority of future research.

TI  - Dicer regulates Nosema ceranae proliferation in honeybees.
PG  - 74-85
LID - 10.1111/imb.12534 [doi]
AB  - Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian parasite that infects the honeybee midgut 
      epithelium. The protein-coding gene Dicer is lost in most microsporidian genomes but 
      is present in N. ceranae. By feeding infected honeybees with small interfering RNA 
      targeting the N. ceranae gene coding Dicer (siRNA-Dicer), we found that N. ceranae 
      spore loads were significantly reduced. In addition, over 10% of total parasite 
      protein-coding genes showed significantly divergent expression profiles after 
      siRNA-Dicer treatment. Parasite genes for cell proliferation, ABC transporters and 
      hexokinase were downregulated at 3 days postinfection, a key point in the middle of 
      parasite replication cycles. In addition, genes involved in metabolic pathways of 
      honeybees and N. ceranae showed significant co-expression. Furthermore, the 
      siRNA-Dicer treatment partly reversed the expression patterns of honeybee genes. The 
      honeybee gene mucin-2-like showed significantly upregulation in the siRNA-Dicer 
      group compared with the infection group continually at 4, 5 and 6 days 
      postinfection, suggesting that the siRNA-Dicer feeding promoted the strength of the 
      mucus barrier resulted from interrupted parasite proliferation. As the gene Dicer 
      broadly regulates N. ceranae proliferation and honeybee metabolism, our data suggest 
      the RNA interference pathway is an important infection strategy for N. ceranae.

TI  - Functional analysis of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene family of 
      Tribolium castaneum.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-14-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to a large 
      superfamily of proteins that have important physiological functions in all living 
      organisms. Most are integral membrane proteins that transport a broad spectrum of 
      substrates across lipid membranes. In insects, ABC transporters are of special 
      interest because of their role in insecticide resistance. RESULTS: We have 
      identified 73 ABC transporter genes in the genome of T. castaneum, which group into 
      eight subfamilies (ABCA-H). This coleopteran ABC family is significantly larger than 
      those reported for insects in other taxonomic groups. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
      that this increase is due to gene expansion within a single clade of subfamily ABCC. 
      We performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to study the function of ABC 
      transporters during development. In ten cases, injection of double-stranded RNA 
      (dsRNA) into larvae caused developmental phenotypes, which included growth arrest 
      and localized melanization, eye pigmentation defects, abnormal cuticle formation, 
      egg-laying and egg-hatching defects, and mortality due to abortive molting and 
      desiccation. Some of the ABC transporters we studied in closer detail to examine 
      their role in lipid, ecdysteroid and eye pigment transport. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      from our study provide new insights into the physiological function of ABC 
      transporters in T. castaneum, and may help to establish new target sites for insect

TI  - The Anopheles gambiae ATP-binding cassette transporter family: phylogenetic analysis 
      and tissue localization provide clues on function and role in insecticide 
      resistance.

AB  - The role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in conferring insecticide 
      resistance has received much attention recently. Here we identify ABC transporters 
      differentially expressed in insecticide-resistant populations of the malaria vector, 
      Anopheles gambiae. Although we found little evidence that the orthologues of the 
      multidrug resistance proteins described in other species are associated with 
      resistance in An. gambiae we did identify a subset of ABC proteins consistently 
      differentially expressed in pyrethroid-resistant populations from across Africa. We 
      present information on the phylogenetic relationship, primary sites of expression 
      and potential role of ABC transporters in mediating the mosquito's response to 
      insecticides. Furthermore we demonstrate that a paralogous group of eight ABCG 
      transporters, clustered on chromosome 3R, are highly enriched in the legs of 
      An. gambiae mosquitoes, consistent with a proposed role for this ABC subfamily in 
      transport of lipids to the outer surface of the cuticle. Finally, antibodies raised 
      against one of the most highly expressed ABC transporters in adult females, ABCG7 
      (AGAP009850), localized this transporter to the pericardial cells. These data will 
      help prioritize members of this gene family for further localization and functional 
      validation studies to identify the in vivo function of these transporters in the 
      mosquito and determine whether elevated expression of members of this family 
      contribute to insecticide resistance.

AB  - Non-biting midges are dominant species in aquatic systems and often used for 
      studying the toxicological researches of insecticides. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporters represent the largest known members in detoxification genes but is 
      little known about their function in non-biting midges. Here, we selected 
      Propsilocerus akamusi, widespread in urban streams, to first uncover the gene 
      structure, location, characteristics, and phylogenetics of chironomid ABC 
      transporters at genome-scale. Fifty-seven ABC transporter genes are located on four 
      chromosomes, including eight subfamilies (ABCA-H). The ABCC, ABCG, and ABCH 
      subfamilies experienced the duplication events to different degrees. The study 
      showed that expression of the PaABCG17 gene is uniquely significantly elevated, with 
      deltamethrin concentration increasing (1, 4, and 20 ug/L) both in RNA-seq and qPCR 
      results. Additionally, the ABC transporter members of other six chironomids with 
      assembled genomes are first described and used to investigate the characteristic of 
      those living in the different adverse habitats. The ABC transporter frame for 
      Propsilocerus akamusi and its transcriptomic results lay an important foundation for 
      providing valuable resources for understanding the ABC transporter function in 
      insecticide toxification of this species as well as those of other non-biting 
      midges. The PaABCG17 gene is shown to play an important role in deltamethrin 
      detoxification, and it functions need to be further investigated and might be used 
      in the management of insecticide-resistance in chironomid adults.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins play important roles in a wide variety of 
      species. These proteins are involved in absorbing nutrients, exporting toxic 
      substances, and regulating potassium channels, and they contribute to drug 
      resistance in cancer cells. Therefore, the identification of ABC transporters is an 
      urgent task. The present study used 188D as the feature extraction method, which is 
      based on sequence information and physicochemical properties. We also visualized the 
      feature extracted by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). The sample 
      based on the features extracted by 188D may be separated. Further, random forest 
      (RF) is an efficient classifier to identify proteins. Under the 10-fold 
      cross-validation of the model proposed here for a training set, the average accuracy 
      rate of 10 training sets was 89.54%. We obtained values of 0.87 for specificity, 
      0.92 for sensitivity, and 0.79 for MCC. In the testing set, the accuracy achieved 
      was 89%. These results suggest that the model combining 188D with RF is an optimal 
      tool to identify ABC transporters.

TI  - Identification of ABCG transporter genes associated with chlorantraniliprole 
      resistance in Plutella xylostella (L.).
PG  - 3491-3499
LID - 10.1002/ps.6402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plutella xylostella (L.) is a serious worldwide pest that feeds on 
      cruciferous plants and has evolved resistance to different classes of insecticides 
      used for its control, including chlorantraniliprole. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporters, constituting the largest transport family in organisms, are involved 
      in phase III of the detoxification process and may play important roles in 
      insecticide resistance. RESULTS: A total of 15 ABC transporter transcripts from 
      subfamily G were identified in P. xylostella based on the latest DBM genome. 
      Synergism studies showed that treatment with verapamil, a potent inhibitor of ABC 
      transporters, significantly increased the toxicity of chlorantraniliprole against 
      larvae of two chlorantraniliprole-resistant P. xylostella populations (NIL and BL). 
      ABCG2, ABCG5, ABCG6, ABCG9, ABCG11, ABCG14 and ABCG15 were significantly 
      overexpressed in NIL and BL compared with the susceptible population (SS), and 
      ABCG1, ABCG6, ABCG8, ABCG9, ABCG14 and ABCG15 were significantly upregulated after 
      treatment with the LC(50) of chlorantraniliprole in SS. Subsequently, ABCG6, ABCG9 
      and ABCG14, which were overexpressed in both NIL and BL and could be induced in SS, 
      were chosen for functional study. RNAi-mediated knockdown of each of the three ABCGs 
      significantly increased the sensitivity of larvae to chlorantraniliprole. These 
      results confirmed that overexpression of ABCG6, ABCG9 and ABCG14 may contribute to 
      chlorantraniliprole resistance in P. xylostella. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of some 
      genes in the ABCG subfamily is involved in P. xylostella resistance to 
      chlorantraniliprole. These results may help to establish a foundation for further 
      studies investigating the role played by ABC transporters in chlorantraniliprole 
      resistance in P. xylostella or other insect pests. © 2021 Society of Chemical

AB  - BACKGROUND: The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, is a 
      pervasive pest of maize in North America and Europe, which has adapted to current 
      pest management strategies. In advance of an assembled and annotated D. v. virgifera 
      genome, we developed transcriptomic resources to use in identifying candidate genes 
      likely to be involved in the evolution of resistance, starting with members of the 
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. RESULTS: In this study, 65 putative 
      D. v. virgifera ABC (DvvABC) transporters were identified within a combined 
      transcriptome assembly generated from embryonic, larval, adult male, and adult 
      female RNA-sequence libraries. Phylogenetic analysis placed the deduced amino-acid 
      sequences of the DvvABC transporters into eight subfamilies (A to H). To supplement 
      our sequence data with functional analysis, we identified orthologs of Tribolium 
      castaneum ABC genes which had previously been shown to exhibit overt RNA 
      interference (RNAi) phenotypes. We identified eight such D. v. virgifera genes, and 
      found that they were functionally similar to their T. castaneum counterparts. 
      Interestingly, depletion of DvvABCB_39715 and DvvABCG_3712 transcripts in adult 
      females produced detrimental reproductive and developmental phenotypes, 
      demonstrating the potential of these genes as targets for RNAi-mediated insect 
      control tactics. CONCLUSIONS: By combining sequence data from four libraries 
      covering three distinct life stages, we have produced a relatively comprehensive de 
      novo transcriptome assembly for D. v. virgifera. Moreover, we have identified 65 
      members of the ABC transporter family and provided the first insights into the 
      developmental and physiological roles of ABC transporters in this pest species.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to a large protein superfamily found 
      in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In arthropods, ABC transporters are 
      involved in defense and resistance to insecticides. The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), 
      Diaphorina citri, is a major vector of the Huanglongbing pathogen (Candidatus 
      Liberibacter asiaticus) worldwide. In this study, the ABC transporter genes were 
      identified based on the transcriptome and genome database of D. citri. A total of 44 
      DcitABC transporters were identified and grouped into 8 subfamilies (ABCA-ABCH), 
      including 4 DcitABCAs, 4 Bs, 5 Cs, 2 Ds, 1 E, 3 Fs, 15 Gs and 10 Hs, respectively. 
      Phylogenetic analysis of ABC transporters revealed a close relationship between D. 
      citri and Laodelphax striatellus. qPCR analyses showed that several DcitABC 
      transporters were highly expressed in fat body, midgut and the hindgut with 
      Malpighian tubules. In particular, DcitABCG11 and DcitABCG14 were most highly 
      expressed in the hindgut. The transcript abundance of 11 DcitABC genes was 
      significantly upregulated upon exposure to an LC(50) concentration of imidacloprid. 
      The expressions of three cytochrome P450 genes and one glutathione S-transferase 
      gene were also significantly elevated. This suggested that DcitABC genes, together 
      with metabolic enzyme genes, are associated with imidacloprid detoxification.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters exist in all living organisms and play 
      major roles in various biological functions by transporting a wide variety of 
      substrates across membranes. The functions of ABC transporters in drug resistance 
      have been extensively studied in vertebrates; however, they are rarely characterized 
      in agricultural pests. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is one of the 
      most damaging pests of the Citrus genus because of its transmission of 
      Huanglongbing, also known as Yellow Dragon disease. In this study, the 
      next-generation sequencing technique was applied to research the ABC transporters of 
      D. citri. Fifty-three ABC transporter genes were found in the RNA-Seq data, and 
      among these ABC transporters, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1, 4, 18 and 15 ABC proteins belonged to 
      the ABCA-ABCH subfamilies, respectively. Different expression profiles of 52 genes 
      between imidacloprid-resistant and imidacloprid-susceptible strains were studied by 
      qRT-PCR; 5 ABCGs and 4 ABCHs were significantly upregulated in the 
      imidacloprid-resistant strain. In addition, five of the nine upregulated genes were 
      widely expressed in adult tissues in spatial expression analysis. The results 
      suggest that these genes may play key roles in this phenotype. In general, this 
      study contributed to our current understanding of D. citri resistance to 
      insecticides.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a large superfamily of proteins 
      that mediate transport of a diverse number of substrates including nutrients, lipids 
      and xenobiotics across membranes serving a variety of developmental and 
      physiological functions. Here, we report on the molecular properties and biological 
      roles of the ABC transporter LmABCH-9C in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. 
      LmABCH-9C was expressed continuously during nymphal development in all tissues 
      including the integument. Expression was highest just after molting. Suppression of 
      LmABCH-9C transcript levels by RNA interference (RNAi) in nymphs provoked death 
      during or soon after molting to the next stage. These nymphs lost weight within 
      minutes after molting. Moreover, high humidity rescued the lethality of molted 
      dsLmABCH-9C-injected nymphs. In histological experiments, we find that the amounts 
      of inner-cuticular lipids are reduced in nymphs with suppressed LmABCH-9C 
      expression. These data together indicate that LmABCH-9C is needed for 
      lipid-dependent desiccation resistance, paralleling the function of ABCH-9C in 
      Tribolium castaneum. Hence, the function of this ABC transporter seems to be 
      conserved across insect species ranging from hemimetabolous (L. migratoria) to 
      holometabolous (T. castaneum) species. In addition, we find that cuticle inward 
      impermeability is compromised in nymphs with reduced LmABCH-9C function. In summary, 
      consistent with the model that cuticular lipids are necessary to prevent desiccation 
      and penetration of xenobiotics in insects, we hypothesize that LmABCH-9C is involved 
      in the construction of a lipid-based barrier at the surface of the cuticle 
      especially after molting to protect the animal against uncontrolled water loss and 
      entry. Susceptibility of this ABC transporter to RNAi-mediated knockdown designates 
      it as an excellent target for RNAi-based insect pest control.

TI  - Genomewide investigation into DNA elements and ABC transporters involved in imazalil 
      resistance in Penicillium digitatum.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.1111/1574-6968.12235 [doi]
AB  - Penicillium digitatum, causing citrus green mold, is one of the most devastating 
      pathogenic fungi for postharvest fruits. The disease control is becoming less 
      efficient because of the dispersal of fungicide-resistant strains. However, 
      genome-scale analyses of its resistance mechanism are scarce. In this work, we 
      sequenced the whole genome of the R1 genotype strain Pd01-ZJU and investigated the 
      genes and DNA elements highly associated with drug resistance. Variation in DNA 
      elements related to drug resistance between P. digitatum strains was revealed in 
      both copy number and chromosomal location, indicating that their recent and frequent 
      translocation might have contributed to environmental adaptation. In addition, ABC 
      transporter proteins in Pd01-ZJU were characterized, and the roles of typical 
      subfamilies (ABCG, ABCC, and ABCB) in imazalil resistance were explored using 
      real-time PCR. Seven ABC proteins, including the previously characterized PMR1 and 
      PMR5, were induced by imazalil, which suggests a role in drug resistance. In 
      summary, this work presents genome information of the R1 genotype P. digitatum and 
      systematically investigates DNA elements and ABC proteins associated with imazalil 
      resistance for the first time, which would be indicative for studying resistant 
      mechanisms in other pathogenic fungi.

TI  - Gene amplification, ABC transporters and cytochrome P450s: unraveling the molecular 
      basis of pyrethroid resistance in the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti.
PG  - e1692
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001692 [doi]
LID - e1692
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyrethroid insecticides are widely utilized in dengue control. However, 
      the major vector, Aedes aegypti, is becoming increasingly resistant to these 
      insecticides and this is impacting on the efficacy of control measures. The near 
      complete transcriptome of two pyrethroid resistant populations from the Caribbean 
      was examined to explore the molecular basis of this resistance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Two previously described target site mutations, 1016I and 1534C were detected in 
      pyrethroid resistant populations from Grand Cayman and Cuba. In addition between two 
      and five per cent of the Ae. aegypti transcriptome was differentially expressed in 
      the resistant populations compared to a laboratory susceptible population. 
      Approximately 20 per cent of the genes over-expressed in resistant mosquitoes were 
      up-regulated in both Caribbean populations (107 genes). Genes with putative 
      monooxygenase activity were significantly over represented in the up-regulated 
      subset, including five CYP9 P450 genes. Quantitative PCR was used to confirm the 
      higher transcript levels of multiple cytochrome P450 genes from the CYP9J family and 
      an ATP binding cassette transporter. Over expression of two genes, CYP9J26 and 
      ABCB4, is due, at least in part, to gene amplification. SIGNIFICANCE: These results, 
      and those from other studies, strongly suggest that increases in the amount of the 
      CYP9J cytochrome P450s are an important mechanism of pyrethroid resistance in Ae. 
      aegypti. The genetic redundancy resulting from the expansion of this gene family 
      makes it unlikely that a single gene or mutation responsible for pyrethroid 
      resistance will be identified in this mosquito species. However, the results from 
      this study do pave the way for the development of new pyrethroid synergists and 
      improved resistance diagnostics. The role of copy number polymorphisms in 
      detoxification and transporter genes in providing protection against insecticide 
      exposure requires further investigation.

TI  - Tribolium castaneum: A Model for Investigating the Mode of Action of Insecticides 
      and Mechanisms of Resistance.
PG  - 3554-3568

AB  - The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is a worldwide insect pest of stored 
      products, particularly food grains, and a powerful model organism for developmental, 
      physiological and applied entomological research on coleopteran species. Among 
      coleopterans, T. castaneum has the most fully sequenced and annotated genome and 
      consequently provides the most advanced genetic model of a coleopteran pest. The 
      beetle is also easy to culture and has a short generation time. Research on this 
      beetle is further assisted by the availability of expressed sequence tags and 
      transcriptomic data. Most importantly, it exhibits a very robust response to 
      systemic RNA interference (RNAi), and a database of RNAi phenotypes (iBeetle) is 
      available. Finally, classical transposonbased techniques together with 
      CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene knockout and genome editing allow the creation of 
      transgenic lines. As T. castaneum develops resistance rapidly to many classes of 
      insecticides including organophosphates, methyl carbamates, pyrethroids, 
      neonicotinoids and insect growth regulators such as chitin synthesis inhibitors, it 
      is further a suitable test system for studying resistance mechanisms. In this 
      review, we will summarize recent advances in research focusing on the mode of action 
      of insecticides and mechanisms of resistance identified using T. castaneum as a pest 
      model.

TI  - Molecular Characterization and Transcriptional Expression Analysis of ABC 
      Transporter H Subfamily Genes in the Oriental Fruit Fly.
PG  - 1298-1309
LID - 10.1093/jee/toab045 [doi]
AB  - The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis Hendel (Diptera: Tephretidae), is a 
      serious pest of fruits and vegetables and has developed high levels of insecticide 
      resistance. ATP-binding cassette transporter genes (ABC transporters) are involved 
      in mediating the energy-driven transport of many substances across membranes and are 
      closely associated with development and insecticide detoxification. In this study, 
      three ABC transporters in the H subfamily were identified, and the possible roles of 
      these genes in B. dorsalis are discussed. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 
      those genes are conserved, typical of half-transporters. The expression profiles of 
      BdABCH genes (BdABCHs) in the developmental stages, tissues, and following 
      insecticide exposure, extreme temperature, warm- and cold-acclimated strain, 
      starvation, and desiccation stress were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. 
      Expression of BdABCHs can be detected in various tissues and in different 
      developmental stages. They were most highly expressed in the hindgut and in newly 
      emerged adults. The mRNA levels of BdABCHs in males (including most tissues and body 
      segments) were higher than in females. The expression of BdABCH1 was significantly 
      upregulated 3.8-fold in the cold-acclimated strain, and was significantly 
      upregulated by 1.9-, 3.8- and 4.1-fold in the 0°C, starvation, and desiccation 
      treatments, respectively. Treatment with malathion and avermectin at LD20 and LD30 
      concentrations produced no obvious changes in the levels of BdABCHs. BdABCHs may be 
      involved in the transport of related hormones during eclosion, as well as water and 
      inorganic salts. BdABCH1 also demonstrated that it is related to the ability to cope 
      with adverse environments.

AB  - In insects, ABC transporters have been shown to contribute to defence/resistance to 
      insecticides by reducing toxic concentrations in cells/tissues. Despite the 
      extensive studies about this detoxifying mechanism, the temporal patterns of ABC 
      transporter activation have been poorly investigated. Using the malaria vector 
      Anopheles stephensi as a study system, we investigated the expression profile of ABC 
      genes belonging to different subfamilies in permethrin-treated larvae at different 
      time points (30 min to 48 h). Our results showed that the expression of ABCB and 
      ABCG subfamily genes was upregulated at 1 h after treatment, with the highest 
      expression observed at 6 h. Therefore, future investigations on the temporal 
      dynamics of ABC gene expression will allow a better implementation of insecticide 
      treatment regimens, including the use of specific inhibitors of ABC efflux pumps.

TI  - A Drosophila ABC transporter regulates lifespan.
PG  - e1004844
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004844 [doi]
LID - e1004844
AB  - MRP4 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 4) is a member of the MRP/ABCC 
      subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that are essential for many 
      cellular processes requiring the transport of substrates across cell membranes. 
      Although MRP4 has been implicated as a detoxification protein by transport of 
      structurally diverse endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, including antivirus and 
      anticancer drugs, that usually induce oxidative stress in cells, its in vivo 
      biological function remains unknown. In this study, we investigate the biological 
      functions of a Drosophila homolog of human MRP4, dMRP4. We show that dMRP4 
      expression is elevated in response to oxidative stress (paraquat, hydrogen peroxide 
      and hyperoxia) in Drosophila. Flies lacking dMRP4 have a shortened lifespan under 
      both oxidative and normal conditions. Overexpression of dMRP4, on the other hand, is 
      sufficient to increase oxidative stress resistance and extend lifespan. By genetic 
      manipulations, we demonstrate that dMRP4 is required for JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal 
      kinase) activation during paraquat challenge and for basal transcription of some JNK 
      target genes under normal condition. We show that impaired JNK signaling is an 
      important cause for major defects associated with dMRP4 mutations, suggesting that 
      dMRP4 regulates lifespan by modulating the expression of a set of genes related to 
      both oxidative resistance and aging, at least in part, through JNK signaling.

AB  - The codling moth Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is one of the most 
      notorious pests of pome fruits and walnuts worldwide, which has developed resistance 
      to almost all classes of insecticides, including abamectin (ABM). ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporters are thought to play a vital roles in insecticide 
      detoxification by reducing the toxic concentrations of insecticides in an organism 
      tissues. Despite the tremendous progress in understanding the detoxification 
      mechanisms at the molecular level, the physiological functions of ABC transporters 
      in insects have been poorly investigated. In this study, we found that the ABC 
      inhibitor verapamil synergized significantly the toxicity of ABM, suggesting a 
      potential role of ABC in detoxification. A total of 54 ABC genes were identified in 
      the third-instar larvae of C. pomonella after treatment with sublethal doses (LD(10) 
      and LD(30)) of ABM. The expression profile of these genes in ABM-treated larvae at 
      different time points (24, 48, 72 hr) using transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) was 
      also investigated. The results showed that the expression of about 30 ABC genes was 
      significantly co-upregulated after treatment. Several specific genes were 
      up-regulated at 48 hr after treatment of larvae with LD(10) ABM. Among these 
      up-regulated genes, we found that the relative expression level of the CPOM19553 was 
      29.7-fold and 16.0-fold higher when larvae were exposed to ABM at the LD(10) and 
      LD(30) doses compared to control, respectively. Unlike other ABC genes, only 
      CPOM08323 exhibited significant expression levels in the head and cuticle of the 
      third-instar larvae of C. pomonella exposed to the two sublethal doses of ABM, with 
      no expression was observed in the detoxification tissues such as midgut and 
      Malpighian tubule. This study suggests that these up-regulated genes may be involved 
      in ABM resistance in C. pomonella. Our findings will provide an additional 
      information required for further analysis of ABC transporter genes associated with 
      xenobiotic metabolism in C. pomonella.

AB  - K(ATP) channels are metabolic sensors that translate intracellular ATP/ADP balance 
      into membrane excitability. The molecular composition of K(ATP) includes an 
      inward-rectifier potassium channel (Kir) and an ABC transporter-like sulfonylurea 
      receptor (SUR). Although structures of K(ATP) have been determined in many 
      conformations, in all cases, the pore in Kir is closed. Here, we describe human 
      pancreatic K(ATP) (hK(ATP)) structures with an open pore at 3.1- to 4.0-Å resolution 
      using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Pore opening is associated 
      with coordinated structural changes within the ATP-binding site and the channel gate 
      in Kir. Conformational changes in SUR are also observed, resulting in an area 
      reduction of contact surfaces between SUR and Kir. We also observe that pancreatic 
      hK(ATP) exhibits the unique (among inward-rectifier channels) property of 
      PIP(2)-independent opening, which appears to be correlated with a docked cytoplasmic 
      domain in the absence of PIP(2).

TI  - Identification of two ABCC transporters involved in malathion detoxification in the 
      red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12981 [doi]
AB  - ABC transporters have been suggested to be involved in insecticide detoxification in 
      different insect species mainly based on the indirect observation of transcriptional 
      upregulation of ABC gene expression in response to insecticide exposure. Previous 
      studies performed by us and others in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, 
      have analyzed the function of TcABCA-C and TcABCG-H genes using RNA interference 
      (RNAi) and demonstrated that specific TcABCA and TcABCC genes are involved in the 
      elimination of the pyrethroid tefluthrin and the benzoylurea diflubenzuron, because 
      gene silencing increased the beetle's susceptibility to the insecticides. In this 
      study, we focused on the potential functions of TcABCA-C genes in detoxification of 
      the pyrethroid cyfluthrin (CF), the organophosphate malathion (MAL) and the 
      diacylhdyazine tebufenozide (TBF). Analysis of transcript levels of selected 
      TcABCA-C genes in response to treatment with these three chemically unrelated 
      insecticides revealed that some genes were particularly upregulated after 
      insecticide treatment. In addition, the ABC inhibitor verapamil synergized 
      significantly the toxicity of MAL but only negligibly CF and TBF toxicities. 
      Finally, silencing of two TcABCC genes by RNAi revealed a significant increase in 
      susceptibility to MAL. In contrast, we did not observe a significant increase in 
      insecticide-induced mortalities when knocking down TcABC genes in larvae treated 
      with CF or TBF, although they were upregulated in response to insecticide treatment. 
      Our results suggest that two pleiotropic ABCC transporters expressed in metabolic 
      and excretory tissues contribute to the elimination of MAL.

TI  - A fungal ABC transporter FgAtm1 regulates iron homeostasis via the transcription

AB  - Iron homeostasis is important for growth, reproduction and other metabolic processes 
      in all eukaryotes. However, the functions of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters 
      in iron homeostasis are largely unknown. Here, we found that one ABC transporter 
      (named FgAtm1) is involved in regulating iron homeostasis, by screening sensitivity 
      to iron stress for 60 ABC transporter mutants of Fusarium graminearum, a devastating 
      fungal pathogen of small grain cereal crops worldwide. The lack of FgAtm1 reduces 
      the activity of cytosolic Fe-S proteins nitrite reductase and xanthine 
      dehydrogenase, which causes high expression of FgHapX via activating transcription 
      factor FgAreA. FgHapX represses transcription of genes for iron-consuming proteins 
      directly but activates genes for iron acquisition proteins by suppressing another 
      iron regulator FgSreA. In addition, the transcriptional activity of FgHapX is 
      regulated by the monothiol glutaredoxin FgGrx4. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of 
      FgHapX, mediated by the Ser/Thr kinase FgYak1, is required for its functions in iron 
      homeostasis. Taken together, this study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism of 
      iron homeostasis mediated by an ABC transporter in an important pathogenic fungus.

AB  - Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, immune suppressant and 
      antimalarial drug. It is a substrate of several human ABC proteins that confer 
      multidrug resistance to cancer cells and determine compartmentalization of a wide 
      range of physiological metabolites and endo or xenobiotics, by their primary active 
      transport across biological membranes. The substrate specificity and tissue 
      distribution of these promiscuous human ABC transporters show a high degree of 
      redundancy, providing robustness to these key physiological and pharmacological 
      processes, such as the elimination of toxins, e.g. methotrexate from the body. A 
      similar network of proteins capable of transporting methotrexate has been recently 
      suggested to exist in Drosophila melanogaster. One of the key players of this 
      putative network is Drosophila Multidrug-resistance Associated Protein (DMRP). DMRP 
      has been shown to be a highly active and promiscuous ABC transporter, capable of 
      transporting various organic anions. Here we provide the first direct evidence that 
      DMRP, expressed alone in a heterologous system lacking other, potentially 
      functionally overlapping D. melanogaster organic anion transporters, is indeed able 
      to transport methotrexate. Our in vitro results support the hypothesized but debated 
      role of DMRP in in vivo methotrexate excretion.

AB  - The clearance of dead cells is a fundamental process in the maintenance of tissue 
      homeostasis. Genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
      mammals have identified two evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that act 
      redundantly to regulate this engulfment process: the ced-1/-6/-7 and ced-2/-5/-12 
      pathways. Of these engulfment genes, only the ced-7/ABCA1 ortholog remains to be 
      identified in D. melanogaster Homology searches have revealed a family of putative 
      ced-7/ABCA1 homologs encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in D. 
      melanogaster To determine which of these genes functions similarly to ced-7/ABCA1, 
      we analyzed mutants for engulfment phenotypes in oogenesis, during which nurse cells 
      (NCs) in each egg chamber undergo programmed cell death (PCD) and are removed by 
      neighboring phagocytic follicle cells (FCs). Our genetic analyses indicate that one 
      of the ABC transporter genes, which we have named Eato (Engulfment ABC Transporter 
      in the ovary), is required for NC clearance in the ovary and acts in the same 
      pathways as drpr, the ced-1 ortholog, and in parallel to Ced-12 in the FCs. 
      Additionally, we show that Eato acts in the FCs to promote accumulation of the 
      transmembrane receptor Drpr, and promote membrane extensions around the NCs for 
      their clearance. Since ABCA class transporters, such as CED-7 and ABCA1, are known 
      to be involved in lipid trafficking, we propose that Eato acts to transport membrane 
      material to the growing phagocytic cup for cell corpse clearance. Our work presented 
      here identifies Eato as the ced-7/ABCA1 ortholog in D. melanogaster, and 
      demonstrates a role for Eato in Drpr accumulation and phagocytic membrane extensions 
      during NC clearance in the ovary.

AB  - Detoxifying pathways of mosquitoes against the neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts 
      are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of 
      adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in this process in 
      Anopheles stephensi, one of the main malaria vectors in southern Asia. Third-stage 
      larvae of An. stephensi were fed with fish food alone or in combination with neem 
      extract at 0.5%, 1%, 5%, and 10%. Six ABC-transporter genes from 3 different 
      subfamilies (B, C, and G) were analyzed to assess their relative expression compared 
      with controls. A bioassay was also performed to assess larval mortality rate at 
      different concentrations and in combination with verapamil, an ABC-transporter 
      inhibitor. No significant variation in the expression levels of any transporter 
      belonging to the B, C, and G subfamilies was detected. Furthermore, the use of 
      verapamil did not induce an increase in mortality at any of the tested neem extract 
      concentrations, indicating that ABC transporters are not involved in the 
      detoxification of neem extracts in An. stephensi larvae.

AB  - The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of metabolites and 
      toxic organic solutes are orchestrated by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporters and the organic solute carrier family (SLC) proteins. A large number of 
      ABC and SLC transpoters exist; however, only a small number have been well 
      characterized. To facilitate the analysis of these transporters, which is important 
      for drug safety and physiological studies, we developed a sensitive genetically 
      encoded bilirubin (BR)-inducible fluorescence sensor (eUnaG) to detect 
      transporter-coupled influx/efflux of organic compounds. This sensor can be used in 
      live cells to measure transporter activity, as excretion of BR depends on ABC and 
      SLC transporters. Applying eUnaG in functional RNAi screens, we characterize 
      l(2)03659 as a Drosophila multidrug resistant-associated ABC transporter.

TI  - Hetero-oligomerization of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A proteins enhance binding to 
      the ABCC2 transporter of Spodoptera exigua.
PG  - 2589-2600
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20210137 [doi]
AB  - The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane proteins that can act as 
      putative receptors for Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in the midgut 
      of different insects. For the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, ABCC2 and ABCC3 have 
      been found to interact with Cry1A proteins, the main insecticidal proteins used in 
      Bt crops, as well as Bt-based pesticides. The ABCC2 has shown to have specific 
      binding towards Cry1Ac and is involved in the toxic process of Cry1A proteins, but 
      the role of this transporter and how it relates with the Cry1A proteins is still 
      unknown. Here, we have characterized the interactions between the SeABCC2 and the 
      main proteins that bind to the receptor. By labeling the Cry1Aa protein, we have 
      found that virtually all of the binding is in an oligomeric state, a conformation 
      that allowed higher levels of specific binding that could not be achieved by the 
      monomeric protein on its own. Furthermore, we have observed that Cry1A proteins can 
      hetero-oligomerize in the presence of the transporter, which is reflected in an 
      increase in binding and toxicity to SeABCC2-expressing cells. This synergism can be 
      one of the reasons why B. thuringiensis co-expresses different Cry1 proteins that 
      can apparently have similar binding preferences. The results from in vitro 
      competition and ex vivo competition showed that Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac share 
      functional binding sites. By using Cry1Ab-Cry1Ac chimeras, the presence of domain I 
      from Cry1A proteins was revealed to be critical for oligomer formation.

AB  - Position-effect variegation (PEV) results when a gene normally in euchromatin is 
      juxtaposed with heterochromatin by rearrangement or transposition. When 
      heterochromatin packaging spreads across the heterochromatin/euchromatin border, it 
      causes transcriptional silencing in a stochastic pattern. PEV is intensely studied 
      in Drosophila using the white gene. Screens for dominant mutations that suppress or 
      enhance white variegation have identified many conserved epigenetic factors, 
      including the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase SU(VAR)3-9. Heterochromatin 
      protein HP1a binds H3K9me2/3 and interacts with SU(VAR)3-9, creating a core memory 
      system. Genetic, molecular, and biochemical analysis of PEV in Drosophila has 
      contributed many key findings concerning establishment and maintenance of 
      heterochromatin with concomitant gene silencing.

TI  - Detoxification Genes Differ Between Cactus-, Fruit-, and Flower-Feeding Drosophila.
PG  - 80-91
LID - 10.1093/jhered/esy058 [doi]
AB  - We use annotated genomes of 14 Drosophila species covering diverse host use 
      phenotypes to test whether 4 gene families that often have detoxification functions 
      are associated with host shifts among species. Bark, slime flux, flower, and 
      generalist necrotic fruit-feeding species all have similar numbers of 
      carboxyl/cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450, and 
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase genes. However, species feeding on toxic Morinda 
      citrifolia fruit and the fresh fruit-feeding Drosophila suzukii have about 30 and 60 
      more, respectively. ABC transporters show a different pattern, with the 
      flower-feeding D. elegans and the generalist necrotic fruit and cactus feeder D. 
      hydei having about 20 and >100 more than the other species, respectively. 
      Surprisingly, despite the complex secondary chemistry we find that 3 cactophilic 
      specialists in the mojavensis species cluster have variably fewer genes than any of 
      the other species across all 4 families. We also find 82 positive selection events 
      across the 4 families, with the terminal D. suzukii and M. citrifolia-feeding D. 
      sechellia branches again having the highest number of such events in proportion to 
      their respective branch lengths. Many of the genes involved in these 
      host-use-specific gene number differences or positive selection events lie in 
      specific clades of the gene families that have been recurrently associated with 
      detoxification. Several genes are also found to be involved in multiple duplication 
      and/or positive selection events across the species studied regardless of their host 
      use phenotypes; the most frequently involved are the ABC transporter CG1718, which 
      is not in a specific clade associated with detoxification, and the α-esterase gene 
      cluster, which is.

AB  - The genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) comprises some of the most polyphagous 
      and destructive agricultural pests worldwide. The success of many species of this 
      genus is due to their striking abilities to adapt to a broad range of host plants. 
      Superfamilies of detoxification genes play a crucial role in the adaption to 
      overcome plant defense mechanisms mediated by numerous secondary metabolites and 
      toxins. Over the past decade, a substantial amount of expression data in Spodoptera 
      larvae was produced for those genes in response to xenobiotics such as plant 
      secondary metabolites, but also insecticide exposure. However, this information is 
      scattered throughout the literature and in most cases does not allow to clearly 
      identify candidate genes involved in host-plant adaptation and insecticide 
      resistance. In the present review, we analyzed and compiled information on close to 
      600 pairs of inducers (xenobiotics) and induced genes from four main Spodoptera 
      species: S. exigua, S. frugiperda, S. littoralis and S. litura. The cytochrome P450 
      monooxygenases (P450s; encoded by CYP genes) were the most upregulated 
      detoxification genes across the literature for all four species. Most of the data 
      was provided from studies on S. litura, followed by S. exigua, S. frugiperda and S. 
      littoralis. We examined whether these detoxification genes were reported for larval 
      survival under xenobiotic challenge in forward and reverse genetic studies. We 
      further analyzed whether biochemical assays were carried out showing the ability of 
      corresponding enzymes and transporters to breakdown and excrete xenobiotics, 
      respectively. This revealed a clear disparity between species and the lack of 
      genetic and biochemical information in S. frugiperda. Finally, we discussed the 
      biological importance of detoxification genes for this genus and propose a workflow 
      to study the involvement of these enzymes in an ecological and agricultural context.

TI  - Characterization and expression profiling of ATP-binding cassette transporter genes 
      in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.).
PG  - 760
LID - 760
AB  - BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are one of the major 
      transmembrane protein families found in all organisms and play important roles in 
      transporting a variety of compounds across intra and extra cellular membranes. In 
      some species, ABC transporters may be involved in the detoxification of substances 
      such as insecticides. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a destructive 
      pest of cruciferous crops worldwide, is an important species to study as it is 
      resistant to many types of insecticides as well as biological control Bacillus 
      thuringiensis toxins. RESULTS: A total of 82 ABC genes were identified from our 
      published P. xylostella genome, and grouped into eight subfamilies (ABCA-H) based on 
      phylogenetic analysis. Genes of subfamilies ABCA, ABCC and ABCH were found to be 
      expanded in P. xylostella compared with those in Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta, 
      Heliconius melpomene, Danaus plexippus, Drosophila melanogaster, Tetranychus urticae 
      and Homo sapiens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that many of the ABC transporters 
      in P. xylostella are orthologous to the well-studied ABC transporter genes in the 
      seven other species. Transcriptome- and qRT-PCR-based analysis elucidated 
      physiological effects of ABC gene expressions of P. xylostella which were 
      developmental stage- and tissue-specific as well as being affected by whether or not 
      the insects were from an insecticide-resistant strain. Two ABCC and one ABCA genes 
      were preferentially expressed in midgut of the 4th-instar larvae of a susceptible 
      strain (Fuzhou-S) suggesting their potential roles in metabolizing plant defensive 
      chemicals. Most of the highly expressed genes in insecticide-resistant strains were 
      also predominantly expressed in the tissues of Malpighian tubules and midgut. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the most comprehensive study on identification, 
      characterization and expression profiling of ABC transporter genes in P. xylostella 
      to date. The diversified features and expression patterns of this gene family may be 
      associated with the evolutionary capacity of this species to develop resistance to a 
      wide range of insecticides and biological toxins. Our findings provide a solid 
      foundation for future functional studies on specific ABC transporter genes in P. 
      xylostella, and for further understanding of their physiological roles and 
      regulatory pathways in insecticide resistance.

AB  - Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) is the major insect herbivore of cotton 
      plants. As its larvae feed and grow on cotton, H. armigera can likely tolerate 
      gossypol, the main defense metabolite produced by cotton plants, through 
      detoxification and sequestration mechanisms. Recent reports have shown that various 
      P450 monooxygenases and UDP-glycosyltransferases in H. armigera are involved in 
      gossypol detoxification, while the roles of ABC transporters, another gene family 
      widely associated with metabolite detoxification, remain to be elucidated. Here, we 
      show that ingestion of gossypol-infused artificial diet and cotton leaves 
      significantly induced the expression of HaABCB6 in H. armigera larvae. Knockdown and 
      knockout of HaABCB6 increased sensitivity of H. armigera larvae to gossypol. 
      Moreover, HaABCB6-GFP fusion protein was localized on lysosomes in Hi5 cells and its 
      overexpression significantly enhanced gossypol tolerance in vitro. These 
      experimental results strongly support that HaABCB6 plays an important role in 
      gossypol detoxification by H. armigera.

TI  - Comparative analysis of dsRNA-induced lncRNAs in three kinds of insect species.
PG  - e21640
LID - 10.1002/arch.21640 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have immune responses to various stimuli have 
      been identified in some insects. One type of pathogen-associated molecular pattern, 
      double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), can trigger the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and 
      immune response. Interestingly, there has been no research into characterizing the 
      relationship between lncRNA and dsRNA-induced RNAi pathways. In this study, 
      dsRNA-induced lncRNAs were investigated in two species of lepidopteran insects, 
      Helicoverpa armigera and Plutella xylostella, and one species of coleopteran 
      insects, Tribolium castaneum. Between untreated group and dsRNA-induced group; 3,463 
      H. armigera, 6,245 P. xylostella, and 3,067 T. castaneum differentially expressed 
      lncRNAs were identified while 156 H. armigera, 247 P. xylostella, 415 T. castaneum 
      lncRNAs and their putative target genes showed consistent changes in gene 
      expression. In T. castaneum, most target genes of the differentially expressed 
      lncRNAs are enriched in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway, ABC 
      transporters, and Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of the 
      transcription signaling pathway. Conversely, in H. armigera and P. xylostella, the 
      differentially expressed lncRNAs were mainly enriched in the metabolic, digestive, 
      and synthetic signaling pathways. This result indicates that dsRNA-induced lncRNA is 
      species-dependent. We also found that both Dicer-2 and the lncRNA that targets 
      Dicer-2 were significantly upregulated after dsRNA treatment in P. xylostella, 
      indicating that some lncRNAs may be involved in the regulation of the core RNAi 
      pathway in insects. Our results are the first to identify a relationship between 
      lncRNAs and dsRNA in various insect species with different RNAi efficiencies. These 
      results provide a reference for future study of the dsRNA-induced RNAi pathway and 
      different RNAi efficiencies among insect species.

TI  - Insecticide Exposure Triggers a Modulated Expression of ABC Transporter Genes in 
      Larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.s.

AB  - Insecticides remain a main tool for the control of arthropod vectors. The urgency to 
      prevent the insurgence of insecticide resistance and the perspective to find new 
      target sites, for the development of novel molecules, are fuelling the study of the 
      molecular mechanisms involved in insect defence against xenobiotic compounds. In 
      this study, we have investigated if ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, a major 
      component of the defensome machinery, are involved in defence against the 
      insecticide permethrin, in susceptible larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles 
      gambiae sensu stricto. Bioassays were performed with permethrin alone, or in 
      combination with an ABC transporter inhibitor. Then we have investigated the 
      expression profiles of five ABC transporter genes at different time points following 
      permethrin exposure, to assess their expression patterns across time. The inhibition 
      of ABC transporters increased the larval mortality by about 15-fold. Likewise, three 
      genes were up-regulated after exposure to permethrin, showing different patterns of 
      expression across the 48 h. Our results provide the first evidences of ABC 
      transporters involvement in defence against a toxic in larvae of An. gambiae s.s. 
      and show that the gene expression response is modulated across time, being 
      continuous, but stronger at the earliest and latest times after exposure.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of resistance and short-term induction response to 
      pyrethroids, in Anopheles coluzzii legs.
PG  - 891

LID - 891
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying comprise the 
      major control measures against Anopheles gambiae sl, the dominant vector in 
      sub-Saharan Africa. The primary site of contact with insecticide is through the 
      mosquitoes' legs, which represents the first barrier insecticides have to bypass to 
      reach their neuronal targets. Proteomic changes and leg cuticle modifications have 
      been associated with insecticide resistance that may reduce the rate of penetration 
      of insecticides. Here, we performed a multiple transcriptomic analyses focusing on 
      An. coluzzii legs. RESULTS: Firstly, leg-specific enrichment analysis identified 359 
      genes including the pyrethroid-binder SAP2 and 2 other chemosensory proteins, along 
      with 4 ABCG transporters previously shown to be leg enriched. Enrichment of gene 
      families included those involved in detecting chemical stimuli, including gustatory 
      and ionotropic receptors and genes implicated in hydrocarbon-synthesis. 
      Subsequently, we compared transcript expression in the legs of a highly resistant 
      strain (VK7-HR) to both a strain with very similar genetic background which has 
      reverted to susceptibility after several generations without insecticide pressure 
      (VK7-LR) and a lab susceptible population (NG). Two hundred thirty-two 
      differentially expressed genes (73 up-regulated and 159 down-regulated) were 
      identified in the resistant strain when compared to the two susceptible 
      counterparts, indicating an over-expression of phase I detoxification enzymes and 
      cuticular proteins, with decrease in hormone-related metabolic processes in legs 
      from the insecticide resistant population. Finally, we analysed the short-term 
      effect of pyrethroid exposure on An. coluzzii legs, comparing legs of 
      1 h-deltamethrin-exposed An. coluzzii (VK7-IN) to those of unexposed mosquitoes 
      (VK7-HR) and identified 348 up-regulated genes including those encoding for GPCRs, 
      ABC transporters, odorant-binding proteins and members of the divergent salivary 
      gland protein family. CONCLUSIONS: The data on An. coluzzii leg-specific 
      transcriptome provides valuable insights into the first line of defense in 
      pyrethroid resistant and short-term deltamethrin-exposed mosquitoes. Our results 
      suggest that xenobiotic detoxification is likely occurring in legs, while the 
      enrichment of sensory proteins, ABCG transporters and cuticular genes is also 
      evident. Constitutive resistance is primarily associated with elevated levels of 
      detoxification and cuticular genes, while short-term insecticide-induced tolerance 
      is linked with overexpression of transporters, GPCRs and GPCR-related genes, 
      sensory/binding and salivary gland proteins.

TI  - Genome Analysis of Dasineura jujubifolia Toursvirus 2, A Novel Ascovirus.
PG  - 134-142
LID - 10.1007/s12250-019-00177-2 [doi]
AB  - So far, ascoviruses have only been identified from Lepidoptera host insects and 
      their transmission vectors-endoparasitic wasps. Here, we reported the first finding 
      of a complete novel ascovirus genome from a Diptera insect, Dasineura jujubifolia. 
      Initially, sequence fragments with homology to ascoviruses were incidentally 
      identified during metagenomic sequencing of the mitochondria of D. jujubifolia 
      (Cecidomyiidae, Diptera) which is a major pest on Ziziphus jujuba. Then a full 
      circular viral genome was assembled from the metagenomic data, which has an A+T 
      percentage of 74% and contains 142,600 bp with 141 open reading frames (ORFs). Among 
      the 141 ORFs, 37 were conserved in all sequenced ascoviruses (core genes) including 
      proteins predicted to participate in DNA replication, gene transcription, protein 
      modification, virus assembly, lipid metabolism and apoptosis. Multi-gene families 
      including those encode for baculovirus repeated open reading frames (BROs), 
      myristylated membrane proteins, RING/U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases, and ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporters were found in the virus genome. Phylogenetic analysis 
      showed that the newly identified virus belongs to genus Toursvirus of Ascoviridae, 
      and is therefore named as Dasineura jujubifolia toursvirus 2 (DjTV-2a). The virus 
      becomes the second reported species of the genus after Diadromus pulchellus 
      toursvirus 1 (DpTV-1a). The genome arrangement of DjTV-2a is quite different from 
      that of DpTV-1a, suggesting these two viruses separated in an early time of 
      evolution. The results suggest that the ascoviruses may infect a much broader range 
      of hosts than our previous knowledge, and shed lights on the evolution of 
      ascoviruses and particularly on that of the toursviruses.

      drug resistance and virulence.
PG  - 1619-28
LID - 10.1128/EC.00171-13 [doi]
AB  - In yeast cells such as those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporter proteins has been found to be increased and correlates 
      with a concomitant elevation in azole drug resistance. In this study, we 
      investigated the roles of two Aspergillus fumigatus proteins that share high 
      sequence similarity with S. cerevisiae Pdr5, an ABC transporter protein that is 
      commonly overproduced in azole-resistant isolates in this yeast. The two A. 
      fumigatus genes encoding the ABC transporters sharing the highest sequence 
      similarity to S. cerevisiae Pdr5 are called abcA and abcB here. We constructed 
      deletion alleles of these two different ABC transporter-encoding genes in three 
      different strains of A. fumigatus. Loss of abcB invariably elicited increased azole 
      susceptibility, while abcA disruption alleles had variable phenotypes. Specific 
      antibodies were raised to both AbcA and AbcB proteins. These antisera allowed 
      detection of AbcB in wild-type cells, while AbcA could be visualized only when 
      overproduced from the hspA promoter in A. fumigatus. Overproduction of AbcA also 
      yielded increased azole resistance. Green fluorescent protein fusions were used to 
      provide evidence that both AbcA and AbcB are localized to the plasma membrane in A. 
      fumigatus. Promoter fusions to firefly luciferase suggested that expression of both 
      ABC transporter-encoding genes is inducible by azole challenge. Virulence assays 
      implicated AbcB as a possible factor required for normal pathogenesis. This work 
      provides important new insights into the physiological roles of ABC transporters in 
      this major fungal pathogen.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria produce Cry toxins that kill insect pests. 
      Insect specificity of Cry toxins relies on their binding to larval gut membrane 
      proteins such as cadherin and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. 
      Mutations in ABC transporters have been implicated in high levels of resistance to 
      Cry toxins in multiple pests. Spodoptera frugiperda is an insect pest susceptible to 
      Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab toxins while Mythimna separata is tolerant to Cry1Fa and less 
      susceptible to Cry1Ab. Here, we analyzed the potential role of ABCC2 in determining 
      the susceptibility of S. frugiperda to Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab, by expressing SfABCC2 or 
      MsABCC2 in Hi5 insect cell line and by the systematic replacements of extracellular 
      loops (ECLs) between these two proteins. Expression of SfABCC2 in Hi5 conferred 
      susceptibility to both Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab, in contrast to the expression of MsABCC2 
      that mediated low toxicity to Cry1Ab and no toxicity to Cry1Fa in agreement with 
      their larvicidal toxicities. The SfABCC2 and MsABCC2 amino acid sequences showed 
      differential residues among ECL1, ECL2, ECL4 and ECL6 loops, while ECL3 and ECL5 
      share the same primary sequence. The exchange of ECLs between SfABCC2 and MsABCC2 
      demonstrated that ECL4 and ECL2 contribute to Cry1Fa toxicity, where ECL4 plays a 
      major role. The medium region (named M2) of ECL4 was identified as the most 
      important region of SfABCC2 involved in Cry1Fa toxicity as shown by point mutations 
      in this region. These findings will be helpful to understand the mechanisms of 
      action of Bt toxins in S. frugiperda.

AB  - Human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that has been 
      implicated in altering the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs in normal tissues 
      and development of multidrug resistance in tumor cells via drug efflux. There is 
      still no definitive explanation of the mechanism by which P-gp effluxes drugs. One 
      of the challenges of large-scale purification of membrane transporters is the 
      selection of a suitable detergent for its optimal extraction from cell membranes. In 
      addition, further steps of purification can often lead to inactivation and 
      aggregation, decreasing the yield of purified protein. Here we report the 
      large-scale purification of human P-gp expressed in High-Five insect cells using 
      recombinant baculovirus. The purification strategies we present yield homogeneous 
      functionally active wild type P-gp and its E556Q/E1201Q mutant, which is defective 
      in carrying out ATP hydrolysis. Three detergents 
      (1,2-diheptanoyol-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, dodecyl maltoside and 
      n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) were used to solubilize and purify P-gp from insect 
      cell membranes. P-gp purification was performed first using immobilized metal 
      affinity chromatography, then followed by a second step of either anion exchange 
      chromatography or size exclusion chromatography to yield protein in concentrations 
      of 2-12 mg/mL. Size exclusion chromatography was the preferred method, as it allows 
      separation of monomeric transporters from aggregates. We show that the purified 
      protein, when reconstituted in proteoliposomes and nanodiscs, exhibits both basal 
      and substrate or inhibitor-modulated ATPase activity. This report thus provides a 
      convenient and robust method to obtain large amounts of active homogeneously 
      purified human P-gp that is suitable for biochemical, biophysical and structural 
      characterization.

TI  - The Antiviral Molecule 5-Pyridoxolactone Identified Post BmNPV Infection of the 
      Silkworm, Bombyx mori.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22147423 [doi]
LID - 7423
AB  - Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a pathogen that causes great economic 
      losses in sericulture. Many genes play a role in viral infection of silkworms, but 
      silkworm metabolism in response to BmNPV infection is unknown. We studied BmE cells 
      infected with BmNPV. We performed liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the cytosolic 
      extract and identified 36, 76, 138, 101, 189, and 166 different molecules at 3, 6, 
      12, 24, 48, and 72 h post BmNPV infection (hpi) compared with 0 hpi. Compounds 
      representing different areas of metabolism were increased in cells post BmNPV 
      infection. These areas included purine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and 
      ABC transporters. Glycerophosphocholine (GPC), 2-hydroxyadenine (2-OH-Ade), 
      gamma-glutamylcysteine (γ-Glu-Cys), hydroxytolbutamide, and 5-pyridoxolactone 
      glycerophosphocholine were continuously upregulated in BmE cells post BmNPV 
      infection by heat map analysis. Only 5-pyridoxolactone was found to strongly inhibit 
      the proliferation of BmNPV when it was used to treat BmE cells. Fewer infected cells 
      were detected and the level of BmNPV DNA decreased with increasing 5-pyridoxolactone 
      in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of BmNPV genes ie1, helicase, GP64, and 
      VP39 in BmE cells treated with 5-pyridoxolactone were strongly inhibited in the 
      BmNPV infection stage. This suggested that 5-pyridoxolactone may suppress the entry 
      of BmNPV. The data in this study characterize the metabolism changes in 
      BmNPV-infected cells. Further analysis of 5-pyridoxolactone, which is a robust 
      antiviral molecule, may increase our understanding of antiviral immunity.

AB  - Extrusion of xenobiotics is essential for allowing animals to remove toxic 
      substances present in their diet or generated as a biproduct of their metabolism. By 
      transporting a wide range of potentially noxious substrates, active transporters of 
      the ABC transporter family play an important role in xenobiotic extrusion. One such 
      class of transporters are the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein transporters. 
      Here, we investigated P-glycoprotein transport in the Malpighian tubules of the 
      desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), a species whose diet includes plants that 
      contain toxic secondary metabolites. To this end, we studied transporter physiology 
      using a modified Ramsay assay in which ex vivo Malpighian tubules are incubated in 
      different solutions containing the P-glycoprotein substrate dye rhodamine B in 
      combination with different concentrations of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil. 
      To determine the quantity of the P-glycoprotein substrate extruded we developed a 
      simple and cheap method as an alternative to liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry, radiolabelled alkaloids or confocal microscopy. Our evidence shows 
      that: (i) the Malpighian tubules contain a P-glycoprotein; (ii) tubule surface area 
      is positively correlated with the tubule fluid secretion rate; and (iii) as the 
      fluid secretion rate increases so too does the net extrusion of rhodamine B. We were 
      able to quantify precisely the relationships between the fluid secretion, surface 
      area, and net extrusion. We interpret these results in the context of the life 
      history and foraging ecology of desert locusts. We argue that P-glycoproteins 
      contribute to the removal of xenobiotic substances from the haemolymph, thereby 
      enabling gregarious desert locusts to maintain toxicity through the ingestion of 
      toxic plants without suffering the deleterious effects themselves.

AB  - Phytophagous insects can tolerate and detoxify toxic compounds present in their host 
      plants and have evolved intricate adaptations to this end. Some insects even 
      sequester the toxins for their defence. This necessitates specific mechanisms, 
      especially carrier proteins that regulate uptake and transport to specific storage 
      sites or protect sensitive tissues from noxious compounds. We identified three 
      ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (ABCB) transporters from the transcriptome of the 
      cardenolide-sequestering leaf beetle Chrysochus auratus and analysed their 
      functional role in the sequestration process. These were heterologously expressed 
      and tested for their ability to interact with various potential substrates: 
      verapamil (standard ABCB substrate), the cardenolides digoxin (commonly used), 
      cymarin (present in the species's host plant) and calotropin (present in the 
      ancestral host plants). Verapamil stimulated all three ABCBs and each was activated 
      by at least one cardenolide, however, they differed as to which they were activated 
      by. While the expression of the most versatile transporter fits with a protective 
      role in the blood-brain barrier, the one specific for cymarin shows an extreme 
      abundance in the elytra, coinciding with the location of the defensive glands. Our 
      data thus suggest a key role of ABCBs in the transport network needed for 
      cardenolide sequestration.

AB  - The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous 
      pest with 353 plant species as its hosts, including maize, sorghum, cotton, and 
      rice. Azadirachtin is one of the most effective botanical insecticides. The effect 
      of azadirachtin against S. frugiperda remains to be determined. Here we report 
      strong growth inhibition of azadirachtin on S. frugiperda larvae under either 1.0 or 
      5.0 μg/g azadirachtin. To explore the relevant mechanisms, the larvae fed with 
      normal artificial diet and with 1.0 μg/g azadirachtin exposure for 3 days were 
      collected as samples for RNA-Seq. RNA-Seq on S. frugiperda larvae under different 
      treatments identified a total of 24,153 unigenes, including 3494 novel genes, were 
      identified. Among them, 1282 genes were affected by 1.0 μg/g azadirachtin exposure, 
      with 672 up-regulated and 610 down-regulated. The impacted genes include 61 coding 
      for detoxification enzymes (31 P450s, 7 GSTs, 11 CarEs, 7 UGTs and 5 ABC 
      transporters), 31 for cuticle proteins, and several proteins involved in insect 
      chitin and hormone biosynthesis. Our results indicated that azadirachtin could 
      regulate the growth of S. frugiperda by affecting insect chitin and hormone 
      biosynthesis pathway. The enhanced expression of detoxification enzymes might be 
      related to detoxifying azadirachtin. These findings provided a foundation for 
      further delineating the molecular mechanism of growth regulation induced by 
      azadirachtin in S. frugiperda larvae.

AB  - A pyramid strategy combining the crystal (Cry) 1A and 2A toxins in Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) crops are active against many species of insects and nematode 
      larvae. It has been widely used to delay pest adaption to genetically modified 
      plants and broaden the insecticidal spectrum in many countries. Unfortunately, Cry2A 
      can also bind with the specific receptor proteins of Cry1A. ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) transporters can interact with Cry1A toxins as receptors in the insect midgut, 
      and ABC transporter mutations result in resistance to Bt proteins. However, there is 
      limited knowledge of the ABC transporters that specifically bind to Cry2Ab. Here, we 
      cloned the ABCC1 gene in Helicoverpa armigera, which expressed at all larval stages 
      and in nine different tissues. Expression levels were particularly high in 
      fifth-instar larvae and Malpighian tubules. The two heterologously expressed HaABCC1 
      transmembrane domain peptides could specifically bind to Cry2Ab with high affinity 
      levels. Moreover, transfecting HaABCC1 into the Spodoptera frugiperda nine insect 
      cell significantly increased its mortality when exposed to Cry2Ab in vitro, and 
      silencing HaABCC1 in H. armigera by RNA interference significantly reduced the 
      mortality of larvae exposed to Cry2Ab in vivo. Altogether current results suggest 
      that HaABCC1 serves as a functional receptor for Cry2Ab.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of the ATP-binding cassette proteins suggests a new ABC 
      protein subfamily J in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 463
LID - 10.1186/s12864-020-06873-8 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed an in-depth analysis of the ABC gene family in Aedes 
      aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), which is an important vector species of 
      arthropod-borne viral infections such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Despite its 
      importance, previous studies of the Arthropod ABC family have not focused on this 
      species. Reports of insecticide resistance among pests and vectors indicate that 
      some of these ATP-dependent efflux pumps are involved in compound traffic and 
      multidrug resistance phenotypes. RESULTS: We identified 53 classic complete ABC 
      proteins annotated in the A. aegypti genome. A phylogenetic analysis of Aedes 
      aegypti ABC proteins was carried out to assign the novel proteins to the ABC 
      subfamilies. We also determined 9 full-length sequences of DNA repair (MutS, RAD50) 
      and structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins that contain the ABC 
      signature. CONCLUSIONS: After inclusion of the putative ABC proteins into the 
      evolutionary tree of the gene family, we classified A. aegypti ABC proteins into the 
      established subfamilies (A to H), but the phylogenetic positioning of MutS, RAD50 
      and SMC proteins among ABC subfamilies-as well as the highly supported grouping of 
      RAD50 and SMC-prompted us to name a new J subfamily of A. aegypti ABC proteins.

TI  - Genome sequence of the corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis Fitch).
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giz033 [doi]
LID - giz033
AB  - BACKGROUND: The corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis Fitch) is the most 
      economically damaging aphid pest on maize (Zea mays), one of the world's most 
      important grain crops. In addition to causing direct damage by removing 
      photoassimilates, R. maidis transmits several destructive maize viruses, including 
      maize yellow dwarf virus, barley yellow dwarf virus, sugarcane mosaic virus, and 
      cucumber mosaic virus. FINDINGS: The genome of a parthenogenetically reproducing R. 
      maidis clone was assembled with a combination of Pacific Biosciences (207-fold 
      coverage) and Illumina (83-fold coverage) sequencing. The 689 assembled contigs, 
      which have an N50 size of 9.0 megabases (Mb) and a low level of heterozygosity, were 
      clustered using Phase Genomics Hi-C interaction maps. Consistent with the commonly 
      observed 2n = 8 karyotype of R. maidis, most of the contigs (473 spanning 321 Mb) 
      were successfully oriented into 4 scaffolds. The genome assembly captured the full 
      length of 95.8% of the core eukaryotic genes, indicating that it is highly complete. 
      Repetitive sequences accounted for 21.2% of the assembly, and a total of 17,629 
      protein-coding genes were predicted with integrated evidence from ab initio and 
      homology-based gene predictions and transcriptome sequences generated with both 
      Pacific Biosciences and Illumina. An analysis of likely horizontally transferred 
      genes identified 2 from bacteria, 7 from fungi, 2 from protozoa, and 9 from algae. 
      Repeat elements, transposons, and genes encoding likely detoxification enzymes 
      (cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases, uridine 
      diphosphate-glucosyltransferases, and ABC transporters) were identified in the 
      genome sequence. Other than Buchnera aphidicola (642,929 base pairs, 602 genes), no 
      endosymbiont bacteria were found in R. maidis. CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality R. maidis 
      genome was assembled at the chromosome level. This genome sequence will enable 
      further research related to ecological interactions, virus transmission, pesticide 
      resistance, and other aspects of R. maidis biology. It also serves as a valuable 
      resource for comparative investigation of other aphid species.

LID - 10.1039/c6ob02813f [doi]
AB  - Benzoylphenylureas (BPUs) are used as synthetic insect growth regulators for 
      inhibiting chitin synthesis. Merging insecticidal BPUs with photoswitchable 
      azobenzene generated photoresponsive chitin synthesis inhibitors. A prepared 
      azobenzene-benzoylphenylurea can be activated upon irradiation with UV light, and 
      shows 6-fold and 2-fold activity difference to armyworm (Mythimna separata) and 
      German cockroach (Blattella germanica) sulfonylurea receptors, respectively. This is 
      the first example of a photoswitchable BPU insecticide. The generation of such a 
      photoresponsive BPU insecticide allows for modulation of the insecticidal activity 
      by light, and may facilitate the spatiotemporal control over the sulfonylurea 
      receptor and the mechanistic study of this kind of insecticide.

TI  - Changes in the expression of four ABC transporter genes in response to imidacloprid 
      in Bemisia tabaci Q (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae).

AB  - Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a globally invasive species 
      complex that causes serious damage to field crops, has developed resistance to 
      imidacloprid and many other pesticides. Insect detoxify to pesticides may partially 
      depend on ABC transporters, which contribute to the detoxification of xenobiotics. 
      To determine whether genes in the ABCG subfamily are involved in imidacloprid 
      detoxification in B. tabaci Q, we cloned four ABCG subfamily genes based on the 
      published MED/Q genome and on our previous study of the transcriptional response of 
      ABC transporters in B. tabaci Q adults to imidacloprid. As indicated by the 
      quantification of mRNA levels after a 6-h exposure, the expression level of ABCG3 
      was 3.3-fold higher in B. tabaci Q adults exposed to 100 μg/mL imidacloprid rather 
      than to the buffer control. The expression level of ABCG3 was higher in females than 
      in males but did not significantly differ among eggs or nymphal stages and did not 
      significantly differ among head, thorax, and abdomen tissues of adults. Knockdown of 
      ABCG3 via RNA interference significantly increased the mortality of 
      imidacloprid-treated laboratory and field-collected adults of B. tabaci Q. These 
      results indicate that the ABCG3 gene may be involved in imidacloprid detoxification 
      by B. tabaci Q.

TI  - Gene selection for studying frugivore-plant interactions: a review and an example 
      using Queensland fruit fly in tomato.
PG  - e11762

LID - e11762
AB  - Fruit production is negatively affected by a wide range of frugivorous insects, 
      among them tephritid fruit flies are one of the most important. As a replacement for 
      pesticide-based controls, enhancing natural fruit resistance through biotechnology 
      approaches is a poorly researched but promising alternative. The use of quantitative 
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is an approach to studying gene expression which 
      has been widely used in studying plant resistance to pathogens and non-frugivorous 
      insect herbivores, and offers a starting point for fruit fly studies. In this paper, 
      we develop a gene selection pipe-line for known induced-defense genes in tomato 
      fruit, Solanum lycopersicum, and putative detoxification genes in Queensland fruit 
      fly, Bactrocera tryoni, as a basis for future RT-qPCR research. The pipeline started 
      with a literature review on plant/herbivore and plant/pathogen molecular 
      interactions. With respect to the fly, this was then followed by the identification 
      of gene families known to be associated with insect resistance to toxins, and then 
      individual genes through reference to annotated B. tryoni transcriptomes and gene 
      identity matching with related species. In contrast for tomato, a much better 
      studied species, individual defense genes could be identified directly through 
      literature research. For B. tryoni, gene selection was then further refined through 
      gene expression studies. Ultimately 28 putative detoxification genes from cytochrome 
      P450 (P450), carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and ATP 
      binding cassette transporters (ABC) gene families were identified for B. tryoni, and 
      15 induced defense genes from receptor-like kinase (RLK), D-mannose/L-galactose, 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), lipoxygenase (LOX), gamma-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA) pathways and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), proteinase inhibitors (PI) and 
      resistance (R) gene families were identified from tomato fruit. The developed gene 
      selection process for B. tryoni can be applied to other herbivorous and frugivorous 
      insect pests so long as the minimum necessary genomic information, an annotated 
      transcriptome, is available.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene family in 
      the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
PG  - 7281-91
LID - 10.1007/s11033-012-1558-3 [doi]
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is a larger protein family with diverse 
      physiological functions in all kingdoms of life. We identified 53 ABC transporters 
      in the silkworm genome, and classified them into eight subfamilies (A-H). 
      Comparative genome analysis revealed that the silkworm has an expanded ABCC 
      subfamily with more members than Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or 
      Homo sapiens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ABCE and ABCF genes were highly 
      conserved in the silkworm, indicating possible involvement in fundamental biological 
      processes. Five multidrug resistance-related genes in the ABCB subfamily and two 
      multidrug resistance-associated-related genes in the ABCC subfamily indicated 
      involvement in biochemical defense. Genetic variation analysis revealed four ABC 
      genes that might be evolving under positive selection. Moreover, the silkworm ABCC4 
      gene might be important for silkworm domestication. Microarray analysis showed that 
      the silkworm ABC genes had distinct expression patterns in different tissues on day 
      3 of the fifth instar. These results might provide new insights for further 
      functional studies on the ABC genes in the silkworm genome.

TI  - Molecular Characterization of Eye Pigmentation-Related ABC Transporter Genes in the 
      Ladybird Beetle Harmonia axyridis Reveals Striking Gene Duplication of the white 
      Gene.
PG  - 260-267
LID - 10.2108/zs170166 [doi]
AB  - Many species of ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae) possess vivid body colors. These 
      colors and patterns show diversity between coccinellid species, or even within 
      species. However, the molecular underpinnings of these striking body colors are 
      scarcely understood. One of the candidate pigmentation molecules responsible for 
      ladybird body color is ommochrome pigment, which is well known as the red pigment 
      molecule responsible for the red eyes of Drosophila. Various insects also use 
      ommochrome in body coloration. It is known that ommochrome pigment precursors are 
      imported into appropriate cells by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
      proteins White and Scarlet. Thus, these ABC transporter genes are potentially 
      involved in various color and pattern expressions seen in ladybird beetle species. 
      In this study, in order to identify the repertory of ABC transporter genes 
      responsible for such body colors, we performed molecular characterization of 
      pigment-related ABC transporter genes, especially white and scarlet, in the 
      coccinellid Harmonia axyridis. By using whole genome data for H. axyridis and 
      subsequent RACE-PCR, six white orthologs and one scarlet ortholog were successfully 
      identified. According to the results of functional analyses via RNA interference 
      (RNAi), only one of these genes had a major function in eye pigmentation. Specific 
      effects on body color and pattern were not detected by our RNAi experiments of any 
      of these genes. This is the first report of this striking duplication of white genes 
      and their functional analyses in insects.

TI  - Transcriptome reveal the response to Cry1Ac toxin in susceptible Bombyx mori.
PG  - e21794
LID - 10.1002/arch.21794 [doi]
AB  - Bombyx mori as a representative in Lepidoptera is an important economic insect in 
      agriculture production. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterial pathogen in 
      silkworm production. Understanding how silkworm respond to Bt-toxin can provide 
      guidance to cultivate resistant silkworm strains. Cry1Ac is one type of Bt-toxin. In 
      current research, Dazao, a susceptible B. mori strain to Bt-toxin, was treated by 
      Cry1Ac toxin and compared its transcriptome with untreated samples. This analysis 
      detected 1234 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology, KEGG, and 
      UniProt keyword enrichment analysis showed that DEGs include ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) transporter, stress response, cuticle, and protein synthesis, and folding 
      process. Five ABC genes were upregulated after Cry1Ac treatment including ABCA2, 
      ABCA3, and ABCC4. They are also known as the transporters of Bt-toxin in 
      lepidopteran insect. Expression of cuticle proteins was significantly increased at 
      6 h after Cry1Ac treatment. Sex-specific storage-proteins and heat shock protein 
      were also upregulated in Cry1Ac treated samples. Our data provide an expression 
      profile about the response of Cry1Ac toxin in susceptible B. mori strain.

AB  - Water contamination by cyanobacterial blooms is a worldwide health hazard to humans 
      as well as livestock. Exposure to Microcystins (MCs), toxins produced by various 
      cyanobacterial or blue green algae found in poorly treated drinking water or 
      contaminated seafood such as fish or prawns are associated with hepatotoxicity, 
      nephropathy and neurotoxicity and in extreme cases, death in humans. MC congeners, 
      currently >240 known, differ dramatically in their uptake kinetics, i.e. their 
      uptake via OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in OATP overexpressing human HEK293 cells and 
      primary human hepatocytes. It is thus likely that MC congeners will also differ with 
      respect to the cellular efflux of the parent and conjugated congeners, e.g. via 
      MRPs, MDRs, BCRP or BSEP. Consequently, the role and kinetics of different human 
      efflux transporters - MRP, MDR, BCRP and BSEP in MC efflux was studied using insect 
      membrane vesicles overexpressing the human transporters of interest. Of the efflux 
      transporters investigated, MRP2 displayed MC transport. Michaelis-Menten kinetics 
      displayed mild co-operativity and thus allosteric behavior of MRP2. MC transport by 
      MRP2 was MC congener-specific, whereby MC-LF was transported more rapidly than MC-LR 
      and -RR. Other human transporters (BCRP, BSEP, MRP1,3,5, MDR1) tested in this study 
      did not exhibit interaction with MC. Although MRP2 showed specific MC transport, the 
      MC-LR-GSH conjugate, was not transported suggesting the involvement of other 
      transporters than MRP2 for the conjugate efflux.

AB  - Hexaconazole is a triazole fungicide, which is stable and difficult to degrade in 
      the environment. The existence of hexaconazole could pose a certain risk to the 
      environment and the health of living organisms. In this study, an efficient 
      degradation strain B-3 (Sphingobacterium multivorum) of hexaconazole was isolated 
      from sewage, activated sludge, and soil. The degradation efficiency of hexaconazole 
      can reach 85.6% in 6 days at a temperature of 32.5 °C, pH of 6.31, initial inoculum 
      of 0.4 g L(-1) and initial concentration of hexaconazole of 50 mg L(-1). During 
      degradation, three metabolites (M1: 2-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(1H-1, 2, 
      4-triazol-1-yl) hexane-2, 5-diol; M2: 2-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl) hexane-1, 2-diol; M3: 
      1H-1, 2, 4-triazole) were identified. Moreover, 45.6% hexaconazole can be degraded 
      in 60 days in natural soil containing B-3. The results of the transcriptome 
      sequencing indicated the presence of 864 differential genes, in which aldehyde 
      dehydrogenase, monooxygenase, RND transporters, and ABC transporters were 
      up-regulated. The generation of 2-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1-yl) 
      hexane-2, 5-diol may be due to the participation of monooxygenase.

TI  - Identification and Functional Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in Myzus 
      persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Response to Trans-anethole.
LID - 10.1093/jisesa/ieab094 [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - Plant essential oils, with high bioactivity and biodegradability, provide promising 
      alternatives to synthetic pesticides for pest control. Trans-anethole is the major 
      component of essential oil from star anise, Illicium verum Hook. The compound has a 
      strong contact toxicity against the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) 
      (Hemiptera: Aphididae), which is a major insect pest of many vegetables and crops. 
      However, little information is known about how M. persicae responds to 
      trans-anethole at the molecular level. We conducted a comparative transcriptome 
      analysis of M. persicae in response to a LD50 dose of trans-anethole. A total of 559 
      differentially expressed genes were detected in the treated individuals, with 318 
      genes up-regulated, and 241 genes down-regulated. Gene ontology (GO) analysis 
      revealed that these genes were classified into different biological processes and 
      pathways. We also found that genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, 
      DnaJ, and cuticle proteins were dramatically up-regulated in response to 
      trans-anethole. To study the function of these genes, we performed RNA interference 
      (RNAi) analysis. Knockdown of an ABC transporter gene (ABCG4) and a DnaJ gene 
      (DnaJC1) resulted in a significantly increased mortality rate in M. persicae 
      following trans-anethole exposure, indicating the involvement of these two genes in 
      the toxicity response to trans-anethole. The findings provide new insights into the 
      mechanisms of M. persicae in coping with plant essential oils.

TI  - The Spodoptera exigua ABCC2 Acts as a Cry1A Receptor Independently of its Nucleotide 
      Binding Domain II.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11030172 [doi]
LID - 172
AB  - ABC proteins are primary-active transporters that require the binding and hydrolysis 
      of ATP to transport substrates across the membrane. Since the first report of an 
      ABCC2 transporter as receptor of Cry1A toxins, the number of ABC transporters known 
      to be involved in the mode of action of Cry toxins has increased. In Spodoptera 
      exigua, a mutation in the SeABCC2 gene is described as genetically linked to 
      resistance to the Bt-product Xentari(TM). This mutation affects an intracellular 
      domain involved in ATP binding, but not the extracellular loops. We analyzed whether 
      this mutation affects the role of the SeABCC2 as a functional receptor to Cry1A 
      toxins. The results show that Sf21 cells expressing the truncated form of the 
      transporter were susceptible to Cry1A toxins. Moreover, specific Cry1Ac binding was 
      observed in those cells expressing the truncated SeABCC2. Additionally, no 
      differences in the irreversible Cry1Ac binding component (associated with the toxin 
      insertion into the membrane) were observed when tested in Sf21 cells expressing 
      either the full-length or the truncated form of the SeABCC2 transporter. Therefore, 
      our results point out that the partial lack of the nucleotide binding domain II in 
      the truncated transporter does not affect its functionality as a Cry1A receptor.

AB  - White-backed planthopper, Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), 
      one of the main agricultural insect pests in China, is resistant to a wide variety 
      of insecticides. We used transcriptome analysis to compare the expression patterns 
      of resistance- and stress-response genes in S. furcifera subjected to imidacloprid, 
      deltamethrin, and triazophos stress, to determine the molecular mechanisms of 
      resistance to these insecticides. A comparative analysis of gene expression under 
      imidacloprid, deltamethrin, and triazophos stress revealed 1,123, 841, and 316 
      upregulated unigenes, respectively, compared to the control. These upregulated genes 
      included seven P450s (two CYP2 clade, three CYP3 clade, and two CYP4 clade), one 
      GST, one ABC transporter (ABCF), and seven Hsps (one 90 and six Hsp70s) under 
      imidacloprid stress; one P450 (CYP3 clade), two ABC transporters (one ABCF and one 
      ABCD), and one Hsp (Hsp90) under deltamethrin stress; one P450 (CYP3 clade) and one 
      ABC transporter (ABCF) under triazophos stress. In addition, 80 genes were commonly 
      upregulated in response to the three insecticide treatments, including laminin, 
      larval cuticle protein, and fasciclin, which are associated with epidermal 
      formation. These results provide a valuable resource for the molecular 
      characterisation of insecticide action in S. furcifera, especially the molecular 
      characteristics of insecticide cross resistance.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis and molecular docking reveal genes involved in the response 
      of Aedes aegypti larvae to an essential oil extracted from Eucalyptus.
PG  - e0009587

LID - e0009587
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti (L.) is an urban mosquito, vector of several arboviruses 
      that cause severe diseases in hundreds of million people each year. The resistance 
      to synthetic insecticides developed by Ae. aegypti populations worldwide has 
      contributed to failures in vector control campaigns, increasing the impact of 
      arbovirus diseases. In this context, plant-derived essential oils with larvicidal 
      activity could be an attractive alternative for vector control. However, the mode of 
      action and the detoxificant response of mosquitoes to plant derived compounds have 
      not been established, impairing the optimization of their use. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      Here we compare gene expression in Ae. aegypti larvae after 14 hrs of exposure to 
      Eucalyptus camaldulensis essential oil with a control group exposed to vehicle 
      (acetone) for the same lapse, by using RNA-Seq. We found differentially expressed 
      genes encoding for cuticle proteins, fatty-acid synthesis, membrane transporters and 
      detoxificant related gene families (i.e. heat shock proteins, cytochromes P450, 
      glutathione transferases, UDP-glycosyltransferases and ABC transporters). Finally, 
      our RNA-Seq and molecular docking results provide evidence pointing to a central 
      involvement of chemosensory proteins in the detoxificant response in mosquitoes. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our work contributes to the understanding of the 
      physiological response of Ae. aegypti larvae to an intoxication with a natural toxic 
      distilled from Eucalyptus leafs. The results suggest an involvement of most of the 
      gene families associated to detoxification of xenobiotics in insects. Noteworthy, 
      this work provides important information regarding the implication of chemosensory 
      proteins in the detoxification of a natural larvicide. Understanding the mode of 
      detoxification of Eucalyptus distilled compounds could contribute to their 
      implementation as a tool in mosquito control.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions dominate the planet's terrestrial ecology. When it 
      comes to host-plant specialization, insects are among the most versatile 
      evolutionary innovators, able to disarm multiple chemical plant defenses. 
      Sequestration is a widespread strategy to detoxify noxious metabolites, frequently 
      for the insect's own benefit against predation. In this study, we describe the 
      broad-spectrum ATP-binding cassette transporter CpMRP of the poplar leaf beetle, 
      Chrysomela populi as the first candidate involved in the sequestration of 
      phytochemicals in insects. CpMRP acts in the defensive glands of the larvae as a 
      pacemaker for the irreversible shuttling of pre-selected metabolites from the 
      hemolymph into defensive secretions. Silencing CpMRP in vivo creates a defenseless 
      phenotype, indicating its role in the secretion process is crucial. In the defensive 
      glands of related leaf beetle species, we identified sequences similar to CpMRP and 
      assume therefore that exocrine gland-based defensive strategies, evolved by these 
      insects to repel their enemies, rely on ABC transporters as a key element. DOI:

TI  - Manganese acquisition is essential for virulence of Enterococcus faecalis.
PG  - e1007102

LID - e1007102
AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient that is not readily available to 
      pathogens during infection due to an active host defense mechanism known as 
      nutritional immunity. To overcome this nutrient restriction, bacteria utilize 
      high-affinity transporters that allow them to compete with host metal-binding 
      proteins. Despite the established role of Mn in bacterial pathogenesis, little is 
      known about the relevance of Mn in the pathophysiology of E. faecalis. Here, we 
      identified and characterized the major Mn acquisition systems of E. faecalis. We 
      discovered that the ABC-type permease EfaCBA and two Nramp-type transporters, named 
      MntH1 and MntH2, work collectively to promote cell growth under Mn-restricted 
      conditions. The simultaneous inactivation of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 
      (ΔefaΔmntH1ΔmntH2 strain) led to drastic reductions (>95%) in cellular Mn content, 
      severe growth defects in body fluids (serum and urine) ex vivo, significant loss of 
      virulence in Galleria mellonella, and virtually complete loss of virulence in rabbit 
      endocarditis and murine catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) models. 
      Despite the functional redundancy of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 under in vitro or ex 
      vivo conditions and in the invertebrate model, dual inactivation of efaCBA and mntH2 
      (ΔefaΔmntH2 strain) was sufficient to prompt maximal sensitivity to calprotectin, a 
      Mn- and Zn-chelating host antimicrobial protein, and for the loss of virulence in 
      mammalian models. Interestingly, EfaCBA appears to play a prominent role during 
      systemic infection, whereas MntH2 was more important during CAUTI. The different 
      roles of EfaCBA and MntH2 in these sites could be attributed, at least in part, to 
      the differential expression of efaA and mntH2 in cells isolated from hearts or from 
      bladders. Collectively, this study demonstrates that Mn acquisition is essential for 
      the pathogenesis of E. faecalis and validates Mn uptake systems as promising targets 
      for the development of new antimicrobials.

TI  - Trametinib modulates cancer multidrug resistance by targeting ABCB1 transporter.
PG  - 15494-509
AB  - Overexpression of adenine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is 
      one of the main reasons of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Trametinib, a 
      novel specific small-molecule mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated 
      kinase (MEK) inhibitor, is currently used for the treatment of melanoma in clinic. 
      In this study, we investigated the effect of trametinib on MDR mediated by ABC 
      transporters. Trametinib significantly potentiated the effects of two ABCB1 
      substrates vincristine and doxorubicin on inhibition of growth, arrest of cell cycle 
      and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressed ABCB1, but not ABCC1 and 
      ABCG2. Furthermore, trametinib did not alter the sensitivity of non-ABCB1 substrate 
      cisplatin. Mechanistically, trametinib potently blocked the drug-efflux activity of 
      ABCB1 to increase the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin 
      and stimulates the ATPase of ABCB1 without alteration of the expression of ABCB1. 
      Importantly, trametinib remarkably enhanced the effect of vincristine against the 
      xenografts of ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells in nude mice. The predicted binding 
      mode showed the hydrophobic interactions of trametinib within the large drug binding 
      cavity of ABCB1. Consequently, our findings may have important implications for use 
      of trametinib in combination therapy for cancer treatment.

AB  - Cry protein toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are now widely used in 
      sprays and transgenic crops to control insect pests. Most recently, ATP-binding 
      cassette transporter proteins (ABC transporter), including ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCG1, 
      ABCA2 and ABCB1, were reported as putative receptors for different Cry toxins. 
      However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism involved in the expression 
      of these ABC transporter genes. In the present study, a conserved target site of 
      miR-998-3p was identified from the coding sequence (CDS) of ABCC2 in diverse 
      lepidopteran insects. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-998-3p could 
      bind to the CDS of ABCC2 and down-regulate its expression through a conserved site 
      and several non-conserved sites in three representative lepidopteran pests, 
      including Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera exigua and Plutella xylostella. Injection 
      of miR-998-3p agomir significantly reduced the abundance of ABCC2, accompanied by 
      increased tolerance to Cry1Ac toxin in H. armigera, S. exigua and P. xylostella 
      (Cry-S) larvae, while injection of miR-998-3p antagomir increased the abundance of 
      ABCC2 dramatically, and thereby reduced the Cry1Ac resistance in a Cry1Ac resistant 
      population of P. xylostella (GX-R). These results give a better understanding of the 
      mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of ABCC2, and will be helpful for 
      further studies on the role of miRNAs in the regulation of Cry1Ac resistance in 
      lepidopteran pests.

AB  - Living organisms have evolved an array of genes coding for detoxifying enzymes and 
      efflux protein pumps, to cope with endogenous and xenobiotic toxic compounds. The 
      study of the genes activated during toxic exposure is relevant to the area of 
      arthropod vector control, since these genes are one of the targets upon which 
      natural selection acts for the evolution of insecticide resistance. ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporters participate to insecticide detoxification acting as 
      efflux pumps, that reduce the intracellular concentration of toxic compounds, or of 
      their metabolic derivatives. Here we analyzed the modulation of the expression of 
      six genes coding for ABC transporters, after the exposure of adult females and males 
      of the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, a major malaria vector in Asia, to permethrin. 
      Male and female mosquitoes were exposed to insecticide for one hour, then the 
      expression profiles of the ABC transporter genes AnstABCB2, AnstABCB3, AnstABCB4, 
      AnstABCBmember6, AnstABCC11, and AnstABCG4 were analysed after one and 24h. Our 
      results showed that three genes (AnstABCB2, AnstABCBmember6, AnstABCG4) were 
      up-regulated in both sexes; two of these (AnstABCBmember6 and AnstABCG4) have 
      previously been shown to be up-regulated also in larval stages of An. stephensi, 
      supporting a role for these genes in permethrin defence in larvae as well as in 
      adults. Finally, the same ABC transporter genes were activated both in females and 
      males; however, the timing of gene induction was different, with a prompter 
      induction in females than in males.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family functions in the ATP-dependent 
      transportation of various substrates across biological membranes. ABC proteins 
      participate in various biological processes and insecticide resistance in insects, 
      and are divided into eight subfamilies (A-H). Mosquitoes are important vectors of 
      human diseases, but the mechanism by which the ABC transporter family evolves in 
      mosquitoes is unknown. In this study, we classified and compared the ABC transporter 
      families of three mosquitoes, namely, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Culex 
      pipiens quinquefasciatus. The three mosquitoes have 55, 69, and 70 ABC genes, 
      respectively. The C. p. quinquefasciatus had approximately 40% and 65% expansion in 
      the ABCG subfamily, mainly in ABCG1/G4, compared with the two other mosquito 
      species. The ABCB, ABCD, ABCE, and ABCF subfamilies were conserved in the three 
      mosquito species. The C. p. quinquefasciatus transcriptomes during development 
      showed that the ABCG and ABCC genes were mainly highly expressed at the egg and 
      pupal stages. The pigment-transport relative brown, white, and scarlet, as well as 
      the ABCF subfamily, were highly expressed at the egg stage. The highly expressed 
      genes in larvae included three ABCA3 genes. The majority of the highly expressed 
      genes in adults were ABCG1/4 genes. These results provided insights into the 
      evolution of the ABC transporter family in mosquitoes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheat leaf rust is an important disease worldwide. Understanding the 
      pathogenic molecular mechanism of Puccinia triticina Eriks. (Pt) and the inconstant 
      toxic region is critical for managing the disease. The present study aimed to 
      analyze the pathogenic divergence between Pt isolates. RESULTS: Total RNA was 
      extracted from the wheat cultivar Thatcher infected by two Pt isolates, Tc361_1 
      (THTT) and Tc284_2 (THTS), at 144 h post inoculation (hpi). The mRNA was then 
      sequenced, and a total of 2784 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected. 
      Forty-five genes were specifically expressed in THTT; these genes included 
      transcription initiation factors and genes with transmembrane transporter activity 
      and other genes. Twenty-six genes were specifically expressed in THTS, including 
      genes with GTPase activity, ABC transporters and other genes. Fifty-four 
      differentially expressed candidate effectors were screened from the two isolates. 
      Two candidate effectors were chosen and validated on tobacco, and the results showed 
      that they could inhibit necrosis induced by BAX. qRT-PCR of 12 significant DEGs was 
      carried out to validate that the results are similar to those of RNA-seq at 144 hpi, 
      to show the expression levels of these DEGs in the early stage and to elucidate the 
      differences in expression between the two Pt pathotypes. CONCLUSION: The results 
      obtained in this study showed that although the two pathotypes of THTT and THTS 
      contribute similar virulence to wheat, there are a large number of genes participate 
      in the interaction with the susceptible wheat cultivar Thatcher, and revealed the 
      pathogenicity of rust is very complicated.

LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12570 [doi]
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera, cotton bollworm, is one of the most disastrous pests 
      worldwide, threatening various food and economic crops. Functional genomic tools may 
      provide efficient approaches for its management. The clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, 
      dependent on a single guide RNA (sgRNA), has been used to induce indels for targeted 
      mutagenesis in cotton bollworm. However, genomic deletions may be more desirable to 
      disrupt the function of noncoding genes or regulatory sequences. By injecting two 
      sgRNAs with Cas9 protein targeting different exons, we obtained predictable genomic 
      deletions of several hundred bases. We achieved this type of modification with 
      different combinations of sgRNA pairs, including HaCad and HaABCC2. Our finding 
      indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used as an efficient tool to engineer genomes with 
      chromosomal deletion in H. armigera.

TI  - Transcriptional Responses in Defense-Related Genes of Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: 
      Aphididae) Feeding on Wheat and Barley.
PG  - 382-395
LID - 10.1093/jee/toy329 [doi]
AB  - Many aphids can adapt on plants of differential resistance levels, but molecular 
      interactions underlying host plant utilization and shift of aphids are still not 
      well understood. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome and compared global gene 
      expression profiles of Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) feeding on wheat (i.e., the 
      susceptible plant) and barley (i.e., the resistant plant). In total, 65,200 
      high-quality unigenes were identified from the merged transcriptomes, and 861 of 
      them were differentially expressed. Relative to their expression on barley, all 
      differentially expressed P450 (cytochrome 450 monooxygenase) genes (e.g., 
      SavCYP6A13, SavCYP4C1, and SavCYP4G15) in S. avenae on wheat were upregulated, 
      suggesting the significance of P450s in xenobiotic metabolism for this aphid on 
      wheat. For S. avenae on barley, some genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporters (e.g., ABCG1, ABCG4, ABCB7, and ABCA5) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 
      (UGTs; e.g., UGT2B1 and UGT2C1) showed a dramatic increase in expression, suggesting 
      that ABC transporters and UGTs could be critical for detoxification metabolism in S. 
      avenae on barley. In addition, the expression for nearly all differentially 
      expressed proteases was upregulated for S. avenae on barley, reflecting xenobiotic 
      challenges facing S. avenae on resistant barley. Thus, various detoxification and 
      other defense-related genes (e.g., proteases and oxidases) showed highly inducible 
      transcript regulation, suggesting great adaptive potential for S. avenae on 
      different plants. All the abovementioned genes will be prime candidates for further 
      studies of molecular interactions underlying host plant use and specialization in 
      this aphid. Our results provide insights into aphids' defenses against variable 
      phytochemicals, and the molecular basis underlying aphid-plant interactions as well.

TI  - The Spt10 GNAT Superfamily Protein Modulates Development, Cell Cycle Progression and

AB  - Chromatin remodeling is mediated in part by post-translational 
      acetylation/deacetylation modifications of histones. Histone acetyltransferases 
      (HATs), e.g., members of the GNAT/MYST superfamily, activate gene transcription via 
      promotion of euchromatin formation. Here, we characterized a GNAT family HAT, Spt10 
      (BbSpt10), in the environmentally and economically important fungal insect pathogen, 
      Beauveria bassiana. Targeted gene knockout of BbSpt10 resulted in impaired asexual 
      development and morphogenesis; reduced abilities to utilize various carbon/nitrogen 
      sources; reduced tolerance to heat, fungicides, and DNA damage stress; and 
      attenuated virulence. The ΔBbSpt10 mutant showed disrupted cell cycle development 
      and abnormal hyphal septation patterns. Transcriptome analyses of wild type and 
      ΔBbSpt10 cells revealed the differential expression of 373 genes, including 153 
      downregulated and 220 upregulated genes. Bioinformatic analyses revealed 
      downregulated genes to be enriched in pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, 
      cellular transportation, cell type differentiation, and virulence, while upregulated 
      genes were enriched in carbon/nitrogen metabolism, lipid metabolism, DNA process, 
      and cell rescue, defense, and virulence. Downregulated virulence genes included 
      hydrophobins, cellular transporters (ABC and MFS multidrug transporters) and 
      cytochrome P450 detoxification genes. These data indicated broad effects of BbSpt10 
      on fungal development, multi-stress response, and virulence.

AB  - Spodoptera litura is a destructive agricultural pest and has evolved resistance to 
      multiple insecticides, especially pyrethroids. At present, the resistance mechanism 
      to pyrethroids remains unclear. Four field-collected populations, namely CZ, LF, NJ 
      and JD, were identified to have high resistance to pyrethroids comparing to 
      pyrethroid-susceptible population (GX), with resistant ratio ranging from 11.5- to 
      9123.5-fold. To characterize pyrethroid resistance mechanism, the transcriptomes 
      between two pyrethroid-resistant (LF and NJ) and a pyrethroid-susceptible (GX) 
      populations were compared by RNA-sequencing. Results showed that multiple 
      differentially expressed genes were enriched in metabolism-related GO terms and KEGG 
      pathways. 35 up-regulated metabolism-related unigenes were selected to verify by 
      qRT-PCR and 15 unigenes, including 4 cytochrome P450s (P450s), 5 glutathione 
      S-transferase (GSTs), 1 UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT), 4 carboxylesterases (COEs) 
      and 1 and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC), were all up-regulated in the four 
      pyrethroid-resistant populations. The expression levels of CYP3 and GST3, which were 
      annotated as CYP6A13 and GSTE1, respectively, showed positive correlation with their 
      pyrethroid resistance levels among the four pyrethroid-resistant populations. While 
      the expression levels of CYP5, CYP12, COE4 and ABC5 showed good correlation with 
      their pyrethroid resistance levels in at least three populations. UGT5 had the 
      highest expression level among the tested UGT genes in the four pyrethroid-resistant 
      populations. RNAi mediated silencing of CYP6 increased the cumulative mortality 
      treated by beta cypermethrin and cyhalothrin significantly, while silencing of GST3 
      increased the cumulative mortality treated by fenvalerate significantly. CYP3, CYP5, 
      CYP6, CYP12, GST3, COE4, UGT5 and ABC5 play important roles in pyrethroid resistance 
      among the four pyrethroid-resistant populations. Our work provides a valuable clue 
      for further study of pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in S. litura.

AB  - Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), transmits the 
      causal pathogen of huanglongbing and is a global pest of citrus. D. citri 
      populations exhibit resistance to multiple insecticide modes of action in areas 
      where these chemicals have been overused. We performed genome-wide transcriptional 
      analysis for two field populations of D. citri (Wauchula and Lake Alfred, Florida, 
      USA) that exhibit 1300-fold resistance to the neonicotinoid insecticide, 
      thiamethoxam, and compared it to that of susceptible psyllids collected from the 
      same area and without imposed selection. The Lake Alfred population responded to 
      insecticide resistance by up-regulation of 240 genes and down-regulation of 148 
      others. The Wauchula population exhibited similar patterns to the Lake Alfred 
      population with up-regulation of 253 genes and down-regulation of 115 others. Gene 
      Ontology annotation associated with cellular processes, cell, and catalytic activity 
      were assigned to differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs from Lake Alfred 
      and Wauchula populations were mapped to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes 
      pathways and implicated enrichment of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, 
      extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and 
      insect hormone biosynthesis in the resistant populations. Up-regulation of 60s 
      ribosomal proteins, UDP-gluscoyltransferases, cytochrome c oxidases, and CYP and ABC 
      transporters among thiamethoxam-resistant D. citri implicates a broad array of novel 
      and conventionally understood resistance mechanisms.

AB  - 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World 
      Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted in 
      resistance, and with continued use resistance will likely increase in terms of level 
      and extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran with a well annotated genome 
      allowing both forward and reverse genetic manipulation, numerous studies done on 
      insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is related to malaria mosquitoes allowing for 
      extrapolation. The 91-R strain of D. melanogaster is highly resistant to DDT 
      (>1500-fold) and recently, reduced penetration, increased detoxification, and direct 
      excretion have been identified as resistance mechanisms. Their interactions, 
      however, remain unclear. Use of Gal4/UAS-RNAi transgenic lines of D. melanogaster 
      allowed for the targeted knockdown of genes putatively involved in DDT resistance 
      and has identified the role of several cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), 
      cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette 
      transporters (Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved in decreased sensitivity to DDT. 
      These above findings have been further validated in 91-R flies using a 
      nanoparticle-enhanced RNAi strategy, directly implication these genes in DDT 
      resistance in 91-R flies.

TI  - Evaluation of Reference Genes and Expression Level of Genes Potentially Involved in 
      the Mode of Action of Cry1Ac and Cry1F in a Susceptible Reference Strain of 
      Chrysodeixis includens.
LID - 10.3390/insects12070598 [doi]

AB  - Soybean looper (SBL), Chrysodeixis includens (Walker), is one of the major 
      lepidopteran pests of soybean in the American continent. SBL control relies mostly 
      on the use of insecticides and genetically modified crops expressing Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal Cry proteins. Due to the high selection pressure 
      exerted by these control measures, resistance has developed to different 
      insecticides and Bt proteins. Nevertheless, studies on the mechanistic background 
      are still scarce. Here, the susceptibility of the laboratory SBL-Benzon strain to 
      the Bt proteins Cry1Ac and Cry1F was determined in diet overlay assays and revealed 
      a greater activity of Cry1Ac than Cry1F, thus confirming results obtained for other 
      sensitive SBL strains. A reference gene study across larval stages with four 
      candidate genes revealed that RPL10 and EF1 were the most stable genes for 
      normalization of gene expression data obtained by RT-qPCR. Finally, the basal 
      expression levels of eight potential Bt protein receptor genes in six larval instars 
      were analyzed, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, alkaline 
      phosphatase, aminopeptidases, and cadherin. The results presented here provide 
      fundamental knowledge to support future SBL resistance studies.

TI  - The ATP-binding protein FgArb1 is essential for penetration, infectious and normal 
      growth of Fusarium graminearum.
PG  - 1447-1466
LID - 10.1111/nph.15261 [doi]
AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters act mainly to transport compounds across 
      cellular membranes and are important for diverse biological processes. However, 
      their roles in pathogenesis have not been well-characterized in Fusarium 
      graminearum. Sixty F. graminearum ABC protein genes were functionally characterized. 
      Among them, FgArb1 regulates normal growth and importantly is essential for 
      pathogenicity. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of FgArb1 in pathogenicity were 
      analyzed in this study. FgArb1 interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) FgSte7, and partially modulates plant penetration by regulating the 
      phosphorylation of FgGpmk1 (the downstream kinase of FgSte7). The FgArb1 mutant 
      exhibited dramatically reduced infective growth within wounded host tissues, likely 
      resulting from its increased sensitivity to oxidative stresses, defective cell wall 
      integrity and reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) production. FgArb1 also is important for 
      the production of sexual and asexual spores that are important propagules for plant 
      infection. In addition, FgArb1 is involved in the regulation of protein biosynthesis 
      through impeding nuclear export of small ribosomal subunit. Finally, acetylation 
      modification at sites K28, K65, K341 and K525 in FgArb1 is required for its 
      biological functions. Taken together, results of this study provide a novel insight 
      into functions of the ABC transporter in fungal pathogenesis.

TI  - Reduction of histamine and enhanced spinning behavior of Daphnia magna caused by 
      scarlet mutant.
PG  - e23403
LID - 10.1002/dvg.23403 [doi]
AB  - The ABC transporter, Scarlet, and its binding partner, White are involved in pigment 
      synthesis in the insect eye and mutations in these genes are used as genetic 
      markers. Recent studies have suggested that these transporters also have additional 
      functions in the neuronal system. In our previous study, we generated scarlet mutant 
      in the small crustacean, Daphnia magna and showed that the mutant lacked the eye 
      pigment in the mutant. Here, we show that the scarlet mutant exhibits spinning 
      behavior. This phenotype is partly associated with the presence of light. 
      Metabolomic analysis of a juvenile mutant revealed that the scarlet mutant has 
      approximately one-tenth of the histamine content of the wild type. Application of 
      histamine to the scarlet mutant rescued the spinning behavior in juveniles, 
      suggesting that the spinning behavior of the mutant is caused by the reduction of 
      histamine. However, the altered behavior was not rescued in the adult mutant by the 
      addition of histamine, suggesting that Scarlet plays an irreversible role in the 
      development of histaminergic neurons. These results suggest that Scarlet plays an 
      important role in histaminergic signaling, which might be related to control the 
      spinning behavior, in addition to its role in eye pigmentation.

TI  - In vitro model systems to investigate bile salt export pump (BSEP) activity and drug 
      interactions: A review.

AB  - The bile salt export pump protein (BSEP), expressed on the canalicular membranes of 
      hepatocytes, is primarily responsible for the biliary excretion of bile salts. The 
      inhibition of BSEP transport activity can lead to an increase in intracellular bile 
      salt levels and liver injury. This review discusses the various in vitro assays 
      currently available for assessing the effect of drugs or other chemical entities to 
      modulate BSEP transport activity. BSEP transporter assays use one of the following 
      platforms: Xenopus laevis oocytes; canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV); 
      BSEP-expressed membrane vesicles; cell lines expressing BSEP; sandwich cultured 
      hepatocytes (SCH); and hepatocytes in suspension. Two of these, BSEP-expressed 
      insect membrane vesicles and sandwich cultured hepatocytes, are the most commonly 
      used assays. BSEP membrane vesicles prepared from transfected insect cells are 
      useful for assessing BSEP inhibition or substrate specificity and exploring 
      mechanisms of BSEP-associated genetic diseases. This model can be applied in a 
      high-throughput format for discovery-drug screening. However, experimental results 
      from use of membrane vesicles may lack physiological relevance and the model does 
      not allow for investigation of in situ metabolism in modulation of BSEP activity. 
      Hepatocyte-based assays that use the SCH format provide results that are generally 
      more physiologically relevant than membrane assays. The SCH model is useful in 
      detailed studies of the biliary excretion of drugs and BSEP inhibition, but due to 
      the complexity of SCH preparation, this model is used primarily for determining 
      biliary clearance and BSEP inhibition in a limited number of compounds. The newly 
      developed hepatocyte in suspension assay avoids many of the complexities of the SCH 
      method. The use of pooled cryopreserved hepatocytes in suspension minimizes genetic 
      variance and individual differences in BSEP activity and also provides the 
      opportunity for higher throughput screening and cross-species comparisons.

TI  - Functional Expression of Multidrug Resistance Protein 4 MRP4/ABCC4.
PG  - 1000-1008
LID - 10.1177/2472555219867070 [doi]
AB  - To study the function and structure of membrane proteins, high quantities of pure 
      and stable protein are needed. One of the first hurdles in accomplishing this is 
      expression of the membrane protein at high levels and in a functional state. 
      Membrane proteins are naturally expressed at low levels, so finding a suitable host 
      for overexpression is imperative. Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) or 
      ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (ABCC4) is a multi-transmembrane protein 
      that is able to transport a range of organic anionic compounds (both endogenous and 
      xenobiotic) out of the cell. This versatile transporter has been linked with 
      extracellular signaling pathways and cellular protection, along with conferring drug 
      resistance in cancers. Here we report the use of MRP4 as a case study to be 
      expressed in three different expression systems: mammalian, insect, and yeast cells, 
      to gain the highest yield possible. Interestingly, using the baculovirus expression 
      system with Sf9 insect cells produced the highest protein yields. Vesicular 
      transport assays were used to confirm that MRP4 expressed in Sf9 was functional 
      using a fluorescent cAMP analogue (fluo-cAMP) instead of the traditional 
      radiolabeled substrates. MRP4 transported fluo-cAMP in an ATP-dependent manner. The 
      specificity of functional expression of MRP4 was validated by the use of 
      nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues and MRP4 inhibitor MK571. Functionally expressed MRP4 
      in Sf9 cells can now be used in downstream processes such as solubilization and 
      purification in order to better understand its function and structure.

AB  - In this study, we examined insect and human ABCC transporters closely related to the 
      lepidopteran ABC transporter C2 (ABCC2), a powerful receptor for the Bacillus 
      thuringiensis Cry toxin, for their responses to various Cry toxins. ABCC2 and the 
      lepidopteran ABC transporter C3 (ABCC3) conferred cultured cells with susceptibility 
      to a lepidopteran-specific Cry1Aa toxin but not to lepidopteran-specific Cry1Ca and 
      Cry1Da. One coleopteran ABCC transporter specifically responded to a 
      coleopteran-specific Cry8Ca toxin. ABCC transporters from a dipteran insect and 
      humans did not respond to any of the tested Cry toxins that are active to 
      lepidopteran and coleopteran insects. These results yield important information for 
      our understanding of insect specificity of Cry toxins and provide the first 
      demonstration of a coleopteran ABCC transporter that serves as a Cry toxin receptor.

TI  - Silencing of an ABC transporter, but not a cadherin, decreases the susceptibility of 
      Colorado potato beetle larvae to Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis Cry3Aa 
      toxin.
PG  - e21834
LID - 10.1002/arch.21834 [doi]
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), 
      is a major pest of potato plants worldwide and is notorious for its ability to 
      develop resistance to insecticides. Cry3 toxins synthesized by Bacillus 
      thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis have been used successfully to manage this pest. 
      Resistance to Cry toxins is a concerning problem for many insect pests; therefore, 
      it is important to determine the mechanisms by which insects acquire resistance to 
      these toxins. Cadherin-like and ABC transporter proteins have been implicated in the 
      mode of action of Cry toxins as mutations in these genes render lepidopterans 
      resistant to them; however, clear consensus does not exist on whether these proteins 
      also play a role in Cry3 toxin activity and/or development of resistance in 
      coleopterans. In the current study, we identified the L. decemlineata orthologues of 
      the cadherin (LdCAD) and the ABCB transporter (LdABCB1) that have been implicated in 
      the mode of action of Cry toxins in other coleopterans. Suppression of LdABCB1 via 
      RNA interference reduced toxin-related larval mortality, whereas partial silencing 
      of LdCAD did not. Our results suggest that the ABCB is involved in the mode of 
      action of Cry3Aa toxins; however, no evidence was found to support the role of 
      cadherin as a receptor of Cry3Aa in L. decemlineata.

TI  - Proteome Changes Paralleling the Olfactory Conditioning in the Forager Honey Bee and 
      Provision of a Brain Proteomics Dataset.
PG  - e1900094
LID - 10.1002/pmic.201900094 [doi]
AB  - The olfactory conditioning of the bee proboscis extension reflex (PER) is 
      extensively used as a paradigm in associative learning of invertebrates but with 
      limited molecular investigations. To investigate which protein changes are linked to 
      olfactory conditioning, a non-sophisticated conditioning model is applied using the 
      PER in the honeybee (Apis mellifera). Foraging honeybees are assigned into three 
      groups based on the reflex behavior and training: conditioned using 2-octanone 
      (PER-conditioned), and sucrose and water controls. Thereafter, the brain 
      synaptosomal proteins are isolated and analyzed by quantitative proteomics using 
      stable isotope labeling (TMT). Additionally, the complex proteome dataset of the bee 
      brain is generated with a total number of 5411 protein groups, including key players 
      in neurotransmitter signaling. The most significant categories affected during 
      olfactory conditioning are associated with "SNARE interactions in vesicular 
      transport" (BET1 and VAMP7), ABC transporters, and fatty acid degradation pathways.

TI  - Petunia hybrida PDR2 is involved in herbivore defense by controlling steroidal 
      contents in trichomes.
PG  - 2725-2739
LID - 10.1111/pce.12828 [doi]
AB  - As a first line of defense against insect herbivores many plants store high 
      concentrations of toxic and deterrent secondary metabolites in glandular trichomes. 
      Plant Pleiotropic Drug Resistance (PDR)-type ABC transporters are known secondary 
      metabolite transporters, and several have been implicated in pathogen or herbivore 
      defense. Here, we report on Petunia hybrida PhPDR2 as a major contributor to 
      trichome-related chemical defense. PhPDR2 was found to localize to the plasma 
      membrane and be predominantly expressed in multicellular glandular trichomes of 
      leaves and stems. Down-regulation of PhPDR2 via RNA interference (pdr2) resulted in 
      a markedly higher susceptibility of the transgenic plants to the generalist foliage 
      feeder Spodoptera littoralis. Untargeted screening of pdr2 trichome metabolite 
      contents showed a significant decrease in petuniasterone and petuniolide content, 
      compounds, which had previously been shown to act as potent toxins against various 
      insects. Our findings suggest that PhPDR2 plays a leading role in controlling 
      petuniasterone levels in leaves and trichomes of petunia, thus contributing to 
      herbivory resistance.

TI  - Functional analysis of ABCG and ABCH transporters from the red flour beetle, 
      Tribolium castaneum.
PG  - 2955-2963
LID - 10.1002/ps.6332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter) subfamilies ABCA-C 
      and ABCG-H have been implicated in insecticide detoxification, mostly based on 
      findings of elevated gene expression in response to insecticide treatment. We 
      previously characterized TcABCA-C genes from the model beetle and pest Tribolium 
      castaneum and demonstrated that TcABCA and TcABCC genes are involved in the 
      elimination of diflubenzuron, because RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene 
      silencing increased susceptibility. In this study, we focused on the potential 
      functions of TcABCG and TcABCH genes in insecticide detoxification. RESULTS: When we 
      silenced the expression of TcABCG-H genes using RNAi, we noticed a previously 
      unreported developmental RNAi phenotype for TcABCG-4F, which is characterized by 50% 
      mortality and ecdysial arrest during adult moult. When we knocked down the 
      Drosophila brown orthologue TcABCG-XC, we did not obtain apparent eye colour 
      phenotypes but did observe a loss of riboflavin uptake by Malpighian tubules. Next, 
      we determined the expression profiles of all TcABCG-H genes in different tissues and 
      developmental stages and analysed transcript levels in response to treatment with 
      four chemically unrelated insecticides. We found that some genes were specifically 
      upregulated after insecticide treatment. However, when we determined 
      insecticide-induced mortalities in larvae that were treated by double-stranded RNA 
      injection to silence those TcABCG-H genes that were upregulated, we did not observe 
      a significant increase in susceptibility to insecticides. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      suggest that the observed insecticide-dependent induction of TcABCG-H gene 
      expression reflects an unspecific stress response, and hence underlines the 
      significance of functional studies on insecticide detoxification. © 2021 The

TI  - Midgut transcriptomal response of the rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis 
      (Guenée) to Cry1C toxin.
PG  - e0191686

LID - e0191686
AB  - Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) is one of the important insect pests in rice 
      field. Bt agents were recommended in the C. medinalis control and Bt rice is bred as 
      a tactic to control this insect. However, the tolerance or resistance of insect to 
      Bt protein is a main threat to the application of Bt protein. In order to 
      investigate the response of C. medinalis transcriptome in defending a Cry1C toxin, 
      high-through RNA-sequencing was carried in the C. medinalis larvae treated with and 
      without Cry1C toxin. A total of 35,586 high-quality unigenes was annotated in the 
      transcriptome of C. medinalis midgut. The comparative analysis identified 6,966 
      differently expressed unigenes (DEGs) between the two treatments. GO analysis showed 
      that these genes involved in proteolysis and extracellular region. Among these DEGs, 
      carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase and P450 were differently expressed in 
      the treated C. medinalis midgut. Furthermore, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and 
      carboxypeptidase were identified in DEGs, and most of them up-regulated. In 
      addition, thirteen ABC transporters were downregulated and three upregulated in 
      Cry1C-treated C. medinalis midgut. Based on the pathway analysis, antigen processing 
      and presentation pathway, and chronic myeloid leukemia pathway were significant in 
      C. medinalis treated with Cry1C toxin. These results indicated that serine protease, 
      detoxification enzymes and ABC transporter, antigen processing and presentation 
      pathway, and chronic myeloid leukemia pathway may involved in the response of C. 
      medinalis to Cry1C toxin. This study provides a transcriptomal foundation for the 
      identification and functional characterization of genes involved in the toxicity of 
      Bt Cry protein against C. medinalis, and provides potential clues to the studies on 
      the tolerance or resistance of an agriculturally important insect pest C. medinalis 
      to Cry1C toxin.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters serve a variety of physiological functions 
      as well as play key roles in drug resistance. The genome of the human malaria 
      parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, encodes multiple members of this family, one of 
      which, gABCG2, is transcribed predominantly in the gametocyte stage. Here we use 
      gene deletion and tagging to investigate the expression, localization and function 
      of gABCG2. The protein is found in a single dot-like lipid-rich structure within 
      female, but not male, gametocytes. gABCG2-knockout cell lines produce more 
      gametocytes of both sexes. By contrast, cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols and 
      triacylglycerols are significantly reduced in gABCG2-knockout gametocyte stages. We 
      propose a role for gABCG2 in the regulation of gametocyte numbers and in the 
      accumulation of neutral lipids, which are likely important for parasite development 
      in the insect stages of the parasite life cycle.

TI  - New insight into foregut functions of xenobiotic detoxification in the cockroach 
      Periplaneta americana.
PG  - 978-990
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12486 [doi]
AB  - The physiological functions of insect foregut, especially in xenobiotic 
      detoxification, are scarcely reported because of unimportance in appearance and 
      insufficient molecular information. The cockroach Periplaneta americana, an 
      entomological model organism, provides perfect material to study physiological 
      functions of foregut tissue due to its architectural feature. Through Illumina 
      sequencing of foregut tissue from P. americana individuals (control) or insects 
      treated with cycloxaprid, as a novel neonicotinoid insecticide, 54 193 166 clean 
      reads were obtained and further assembled into 53 853 unigenes with an average 
      length of 366 bp. Furthermore, the number of unigenes involved in xenobiotic 
      detoxification was analyzed, mainly including 70 cytochrome P450s, 12 glutathione 
      S-transferases (GSTs), seven carboxylesterases (CarEs) and seven adenosine 
      triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Compared to control, the 
      expression of 22 xenobiotic detoxification unigenes was up-regulated after 
      cycloxaprid application, mainly containing 18 P450s, one GST, two CarEs and one ABC 
      adenosine triphosphate transporter, indicating that the oxidation-reduction was the 
      major reactive process to cycloxaprid application. Through quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis, the expression of selected unigenes (six P450s, 
      one GST and one CarE) was up-regulated at least two-fold following cycloxaprid 
      treatment, and was generally in agreement with transcriptome data. Compared to the 
      previous midgut transcriptome of P. americana, it looks like the expressive 
      abundance of the xenobiotic detoxification unigenes might be important factors to 
      the detoxifying functional differences between foregut and midgut. In conclusion, 
      insect foregut would also play important roles in the physiological processes 
      related to xenobiotic detoxification.

TI  - Proteomic Analyses Detect Higher Expression of C-Type Lectins in 
      Imidacloprid-Resistant Colorado Potato Beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say.
LID - 10.3390/insects12010003 [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is one of the most adaptable insect pests to both 
      plant toxins and synthetic insecticides. Resistance in CPB is reported for over 50 
      classes of insecticides, and mechanisms of insecticide-resistance include enhanced 
      detoxification enzymes, ABC transporters and target site mutations. Adaptation to 
      insecticides is also associated with changes in behaviour, energy metabolism and 
      other physiological processes seemingly unrelated to resistance but partially 
      explained through genomic analyses. In the present study, in place of genomics, we 
      applied 2-dimensional (2-D) gel and mass spectrometry to investigate protein 
      differences in abdominal and midgut tissue of insecticide-susceptible (S) and 
      -resistant (R) CPB. The proteomic analyses measured constitutive differences in 
      several proteins, but the highest match was identified as a C-type lectin (CTL), a 
      component of innate immunity in insects. The constitutive expression of the CTL was 
      greater in the multi-resistant (LI) strain, and the same spot was measured in both 
      midgut and abdominal tissue. Exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide, 
      imidacloprid, increased the CTL spot found in the midgut but not in the abdominal 
      tissue of the laboratory (Lab) strain. No increase in protein levels in the midgut 
      tissue was observed in the LI or a field strain (NB) tolerant to neonicotinoids. 
      With the exception of biopesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), no 
      previous studies have documented differences in the immune response by CTLs in 
      insects exposed to synthetic insecticides or the fitness costs associated with 
      expression levels of immune-related genes in insecticide-resistant strains. This 
      study demonstrates again how CPB has been successful at adapting to insecticides, 
      plant defenses as well as pathogens.

TI  - RNA-Seq Analyses of Midgut and Fat Body Tissues Reveal the Molecular Mechanism 
      Underlying Spodoptera litura Resistance to Tomatine.

AB  - Plants produce secondary metabolites to provide chemical defense against herbivorous 
      insects, whereas insects can induce the expression of detoxification 
      metabolism-related unigenes in counter defense to plant xenobiotics. Tomatine is an 
      important secondary metabolite in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) that can 
      protect the plant from bacteria and insects. However, the mechanism underlying the 
      adaptation of Spodoptera litura, a major tomato pest, to tomatine in tomato is 
      largely unclear. In this study, we first found that the levels of tomatine in 
      tomatoes subjected to S. litura treatment were significantly increased. Second, we 
      confirmed the inhibitory effect of tomatine on S. litura by adding moderate amounts 
      of commercial tomatine to an artificial diet. Then, we utilized RNA-Seq to compare 
      the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the midgut and fat body tissues of S. 
      litura exposed to an artificial diet supplemented with tomatine. In total, upon 
      exposure to tomatine, 134 and 666 genes were upregulated in the S. litura midgut and 
      fat body, respectively. These DEGs comprise a significant number of 
      detoxification-related genes, including 7 P450 family genes, 8 glutathione 
      S-transferases (GSTs) genes, 6 ABC transport enzyme genes, 9 
      UDP-glucosyltransferases genes and 3 carboxylesterases genes. Moreover, KEGG 
      analysis demonstrated that the upregulated genes were enriched in xenobiotic 
      metabolism by cytochrome P450s, ABC transporters and drug metabolism by other 
      enzymes. Furthermore, as numerous GSTs were induced by tomatine in S. litura, we 
      chose one gene, namely GSTS1, to confirm the detoxification function on tomatine. 
      Expression profiling revealed that GSTS1 transcripts were mainly expressed in 
      larvae, and the levels were the highest in the midgut. Finally, when larvae were 
      injected with double-stranded RNA specific to GSTS1, the transcript levels in the 
      midgut and fat body decreased, and the negative effect of the plant xenobiotic 
      tomatine on larval growth was magnified. These results preliminarily clarified the 
      molecular mechanism underlying the resistance of S. litura to tomatine, establishing 
      a foundation for subsequent pest control.

TI  - Multi-Drug Resistance Transporters and a Mechanism-Based Strategy for Assessing 
      Risks of Pesticide Combinations to Honey Bees.
PG  - e0148242
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148242 [doi]
LID - e0148242
AB  - Annual losses of honey bee colonies remain high and pesticide exposure is one 
      possible cause. Dangerous combinations of pesticides, plant-produced compounds and 
      antibiotics added to hives may cause or contribute to losses, but it is very 
      difficult to test the many combinations of those compounds that bees encounter. We 
      propose a mechanism-based strategy for simplifying the assessment of combinations of 
      compounds, focusing here on compounds that interact with xenobiotic handling ABC 
      transporters. We evaluate the use of ivermectin as a model substrate for these 
      transporters. Compounds that increase sensitivity of bees to ivermectin may be 
      inhibiting key transporters. We show that several compounds commonly encountered by 
      honey bees (fumagillin, Pristine, quercetin) significantly increased honey bee 
      mortality due to ivermectin and significantly reduced the LC50 of ivermectin 
      suggesting that they may interfere with transporter function. These inhibitors also 
      significantly increased honey bees sensitivity to the neonicotinoid insecticide 
      acetamiprid. This mechanism-based strategy may dramatically reduce the number of 
      tests needed to assess the possibility of adverse combinations among pesticides. We 
      also demonstrate an in vivo transporter assay that provides physical evidence of 
      transporter inhibition by tracking the dynamics of a fluorescent substrate of these 
      transporters (Rhodamine B) in bee tissues. Significantly more Rhodamine B remains in 
      the head and hemolymph of bees pretreated with higher concentrations of the 
      transporter inhibitor verapamil. Mechanism-based strategies for simplifying the 
      assessment of adverse chemical interactions such as described here could improve our 
      ability to identify those combinations that pose significantly greater risk to bees 
      and perhaps improve the risk assessment protocols for honey bees and similar 
      sensitive species.

AB  - ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters play prominent roles in numerous cellular 
      processes and many have been implicated in human diseases. Unfortunately, detailed 
      mechanistic information on the majority of ABC transporters has not yet been 
      elucidated. The slow rate of progress of molecular and high resolution structural 
      studies may be attributed to the difficulty in the investigation of integral 
      membrane proteins. These difficulties include the expression of functional, 
      non-aggregated protein in heterologous systems. Furthermore, the extraction of 
      membrane proteins from source material remains a major bottle-neck in the process 
      since there are relatively few guidelines for selection of an appropriate detergent 
      to achieve optimal extraction. Whilst affinity tag strategies have simplified the 
      purification of membrane proteins; many challenges remain. For example, the 
      chromatographic process and associated steps can rapidly lead to functional 
      inactivation, random aggregation, or even precipitation of the target protein. 
      Furthermore, optimisation of high yield and purity, does not guarantee successful 
      structure determination. Based on this series of potential issues, any investigation 
      into structure-function of membrane proteins requires a systematic evaluation of 
      preparation quality. In particular, the evaluation should focus on function, 
      homogeneity and mono-dispersity. The present investigation provides a detailed 
      assessment of the quality of purified ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters; 
      namely ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCA4 (ABCR). A number of suggestions are provided to 
      facilitate the production of functional, homogeneous and mono-disperse preparations 
      using the insect cell expression system. Finally, the ABCA4 samples have been used 
      to provide structural insights into this essential photo-receptor cell protein.

TI  - Transporter Activity Changes in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Assessment with Plasma 
      Coproporphyrin I and III.
PG  - 29-39
LID - 10.1124/jpet.120.000291 [doi]
AB  - Expression and functional changes in the organic anion transporting polypeptide 
      (OATP)-multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) axis of transporters are well 
      reported in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These changes can 
      impact plasma and tissue disposition of endo- and exogenous compounds. The 
      transporter alterations are often assessed by administration of a xenobiotic or by 
      transporter proteomic analysis from liver biopsies. Using gene expression, 
      proteomics, and endogenous biomarkers, we show that the gene expression and activity 
      of OATP and MRP transporters are associated with disease progression and recovery in 
      humans and in preclinical animal models of NASH. Decreased OATP and increased MRP3/4 
      gene expression in two cohorts of patients with steatosis and NASH, as well as gene 
      and protein expression in multiple NASH rodent models, have been established. 
      Coproporphyrin I and III (CP I and III) were established as substrates of MRP4. CP I 
      plasma concentration increased significantly in four animal models of NASH, 
      indicating the transporter changes. Up to a 60-fold increase in CP I plasma 
      concentration was observed in the mouse bile duct-ligated model compared with sham 
      controls. In the choline-deficient amino acid-defined high-fat diet (CDAHFD) model, 
      CP I plasma concentrations increased by >3-fold compared with chow diet-fed mice. In 
      contrast, CP III plasma concentrations remain unaltered in the CDAHFD model, 
      although they increased in the other three NASH models. These results suggest that 
      tracking CP I plasma concentrations can provide transporter modulation information 
      at a functional level in NASH animal models and in patients. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
      Our analysis demonstrates that multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) 
      transporter gene expression tracks with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
      progression and intervention in patients. Additionally, we show that coproporphyrin 
      I and III (CP I and III) are substrates of MRP4. CP I plasma and liver 
      concentrations increase in different diet- and surgery-induced rodent NASH models, 
      likely explained by both gene- and protein-level changes in transporters. CP I and 
      III are therefore potential plasma-based biomarkers that can track NASH progression 
      in preclinical models and in humans.

AB  - The role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the efflux of the 
      insecticide, temephos, was assessed in the larvae of Aedes aegypti. Bioassays were 
      conducted using mosquito populations that were either susceptible or resistant to 
      temephos by exposure to insecticide alone or in combination with sublethal doses of 
      the ABC transporter inhibitor, verapamil (30, 35 and 40 μM). The best result in the 
      series was obtained with the addition of verapamil (40 μM), which led to a 2x 
      increase in the toxicity of temephos, suggesting that ABC transporters may be 
      partially involved in conferring resistance to the populations evaluated.

AB  - Prevention of desiccation is a constant challenge for terrestrial organisms. Land 
      insects have an extracellular coat, the cuticle, that plays a major role in 
      protection against exaggerated water loss. Here, we report that the ABC transporter 
      Oskyddad (Osy)-a human ABCA12 paralog-contributes to the waterproof barrier function 
      of the cuticle in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the reduction 
      or elimination of Osy function provokes rapid desiccation. Osy is also involved in 
      defining the inward barrier against xenobiotics penetration. Consistently, the 
      amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons that are involved in cuticle impermeability 
      decrease markedly when Osy activity is reduced. GFP-tagged Osy localises to membrane 
      nano-protrusions within the cuticle, likely pore canals. This suggests that Osy is 
      mediating the transport of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) through the pore canals to 
      the cuticle surface. The envelope, which is the outermost cuticle layer constituting 
      the main barrier, is unaffected in osy mutant larvae. This contrasts with the 
      function of Snu, another ABC transporter needed for the construction of the 
      cuticular inward and outward barriers, that nevertheless is implicated in CHC 
      deposition. Hence, Osy and Snu have overlapping and independent roles to establish 
      cuticular resistance against transpiration and xenobiotic penetration. The osy 
      deficient phenotype parallels the phenotype of Harlequin ichthyosis caused by 
      mutations in the human abca12 gene. Thus, it seems that the cellular and molecular 
      mechanisms of lipid barrier assembly in the skin are conserved during evolution.

TI  - The miR-9b microRNA mediates dimorphism and development of wing in aphids.
PG  - 8404-8409
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1919204117 [doi]
AB  - Wing dimorphism is a phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity in aphid dispersal. 
      However, the signal transduction for perceiving environmental cues (e.g., crowding) 
      and the regulation mechanism remain elusive. Here, we found that aci-miR-9b was the 
      only down-regulated microRNA (miRNA) in both crowding-induced wing dimorphism and 
      during wing development in the brown citrus aphid Aphis citricidus We determined a 
      targeted regulatory relationship between aci-miR-9b and an ABC transporter 
      (AcABCG4). Inhibition of aci-miR-9b increased the proportion of winged offspring 
      under normal conditions. Overexpression of aci-miR-9b resulted in decline of the 
      proportion of winged offspring under crowding conditions. In addition, 
      overexpression of aci-miR-9b also resulted in malformed wings during wing 
      development. This role of aci-miR-9b mediating wing dimorphism and development was 
      also confirmed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum The downstream action of 
      aci-miR-9b-AcABCG4 was based on the interaction with the insulin and insulin-like 
      signaling pathway. A model for aphid wing dimorphism and development was 
      demonstrated as the following: maternal aphids experience crowding, which results in 
      the decrease of aci-miR-9b. This is followed by the increase of ABCG4, which then 
      activates the insulin and insulin-like signaling pathway, thereby causing a high 
      proportion of winged offspring. Later, the same cascade, "miR-9b-ABCG4-insulin 
      signaling," is again involved in wing development. Taken together, our results 
      reveal that a signal transduction cascade mediates both wing dimorphism and 
      development in aphids via miRNA. These findings would be useful in developing 
      potential strategies for blocking the aphid dispersal and reducing viral 
      transmission.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata developed resistance to 
      imidacloprid after exposure to this insecticide for multiple generations. Our 
      previous studies showed that xenobiotic transcription factor, cap 'n' collar isoform 
      C (CncC) regulates the expression of multiple cytochrome P450 genes, which play 
      essential roles in resistance to plant allelochemicals and insecticides. In this 
      study, we sought to obtain a comprehensive picture of the genes regulated by CncC in 
      imidacloprid-resistant CPB. We performed sequencing of RNA isolated from 
      imidacloprid-resistant CPB treated with dsRNA targeting CncC or gene coding for 
      green fluorescent protein (control). Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that 
      CncC regulated the expression of 1798 genes, out of which 1499 genes were 
      downregulated in CncC knockdown beetles. Interestingly, expression of 79% of 
      imidacloprid induced P450 genes requires CncC. We performed quantitative real-time 
      PCR to verify the reduction in the expression of 20 genes including those coding for 
      detoxification enzymes (P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and esterases) and ABC 
      transporters. The genes coding for ABC transporters are induced in insecticide 
      resistant CPB and require CncC for their expression. Knockdown of genes coding for 
      ABC transporters simultaneously or individually caused an increase in 
      imidacloprid-induced mortality in resistant beetles confirming their contribution to 
      insecticide resistance. These studies identified CncC as a transcription factor 
      involved in regulation of genes responsible for imidacloprid resistance. Small 
      molecule inhibitors of CncC or suppression of CncC by RNAi could provide effective 
      synergists for pest control or management of insecticide resistance.

AB  - Insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are the primary recombinant 
      proteins expressed in transgenic crops (Bt-crops) to confer insect resistance. 
      Development of resistance to Bt toxins in insect populations threatens the 
      sustainable application of Bt-crops in agriculture. The Bt toxin Cry2Ab is a major 
      insecticidal protein used in current Bt-crops, and resistance to Cry2Ab has been 
      selected in several insects, including the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni. In this 
      study, the Cry2Ab resistance gene in T. ni was mapped to Chromosome 17 by genetic 
      linkage analyses using a whole genome resequencing approach, and was then finely 
      mapped using RNA-seq-based bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and amplicon sequencing 
      (AmpSeq)-based fine linkage mapping to a locus containing two genes, ABCA1 and 
      ABCA2. Mutations in ABCA1 and ABCA2 in Cry2Ab resistant T. ni were identified by 
      both genomic DNA and cDNA sequencing. Analysis of the expression of ABCA1 and ABCA2 
      in T. ni larvae indicated that ABCA2 is abundantly expressed in the larval midgut, 
      but ABCA1 is not a midgut-expressed gene. The mutation in ABCA2 in Cry2Ab resistant 
      T. ni was identified to be an insertion of a transposon Tntransib in ABCA2. For 
      confirmation of ABCA2 as the Cry2Ab-resistance gene, T. ni mutants with frameshift 
      mutations in ABCA1 and ABCA2 were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. Bioassays of 
      the T. ni mutants with Cry2Ab verified that the mutations of ABCA1 did not change 
      larval susceptibility to Cry2Ab, but the ABCA2 mutants were highly resistant to 
      Cry2Ab. Genetic complementation test of the ABCA2 allele in Cry2Ab resistant T. ni 
      with an ABCA2 mutant generated by CRISPR/Cas9 confirmed that the ABCA2 mutation in 
      the Cry2Ab resistant strain confers the resistance. The results from this study 
      confirmed that ABCA2 is essential for the toxicity of Cry2Ab in T. ni and mutation 
      of ABCA2 confers the resistance to Cry2Ab in the resistant T. ni strain derived from 
      a Bt resistant greenhouse population.

TI  - Frequency-specific modification of locomotor components by the white gene in 
      Drosophila melanogaster adult flies.
PG  - e12703
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12703 [doi]
AB  - The classic eye-color gene white (w) in Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly) has 
      unexpected behavioral consequences. How w affects locomotion of adult flies is 
      largely unknown. Here, we show that a mutant allele (w(1118) ) selectively increases 
      locomotor components at relatively high frequencies (> 0.1 Hz). The w(1118) flies 
      had reduced transcripts of w(+) from the 5' end of the gene. Male flies of w(1118) 
      walked continuously in circular arenas while the wildtype Canton-S walked 
      intermittently. Through careful control of genetic and cytoplasmic backgrounds, we 
      found that the w(1118) locus was associated with continuous walking. w(1118) 
      -carrying male flies showed increased median values of path length per second (PPS) 
      and 5-min path length compared with w(+) -carrying males. Additionally, flies 
      carrying 2-4 genomic copies of mini-white(+) (mw(+) ) in the w(1118) background 
      showed suppressed median PPSs and decreased 5-min path length compared with 
      controls, and the suppression was dependent on the copy number of mw(+) . Analysis 
      of the time-series (i.e., PPSs over time) by Fourier transform indicated that 
      w(1118) was associated with increased locomotor components at relatively high 
      frequencies (> 0.1 Hz). The addition of multiple genomic copies of mw(+) (2-4 
      copies) suppressed the high-frequency components. Lastly, the downregulation of w(+) 
      in neurons but not glial cells resulted in increased high-frequency components. We 
      concluded that mutation of w modified the locomotion in adult flies by selectively 
      increasing high-frequency locomotor components.

TI  - Mining and engineering exporters for titer improvement of macrolide biopesticides in 
      Streptomyces.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.13883 [doi]
AB  - Exporter engineering is a promising strategy to construct high-yield Streptomyces 
      for natural product pharmaceuticals in industrial biotechnology. However, available 
      exporters are scarce, due to the limited knowledge of bacterial transporters. Here, 
      we built a workflow for exporter mining and devised a tunable plug-and-play exporter 
      (TuPPE) module to improve the production of macrolide biopesticides in Streptomyces. 
      Combining genome analyses and experimental confirmations, we found three ATP-binding 
      cassette transporters that contribute to milbemycin production in Streptomyces 
      bingchenggensis. We then optimized the expression level of target exporters for 
      milbemycin titer optimization by designing a TuPPE module with replaceable promoters 
      and ribosome binding sites. Finally, broader applications of the TuPPE module were 
      implemented in industrial S. bingchenggensis BC04, Streptomyces avermitilis NEAU12 
      and Streptomyces cyaneogriseus NMWT1, which led to optimal titer improvement of 
      milbemycin A3/A4, avermectin B(1a) and nemadectin α by 24.2%, 53.0% and 41.0%, 
      respectively. Our work provides useful exporters and a convenient TuPPE module for 
      titer improvement of macrolide biopesticides in Streptomyces. More importantly, the 
      feasible exporter mining workflow developed here might shed light on widespread 
      applications of exporter engineering in Streptomyces to boost the production of 
      other secondary metabolites.

TI  - Putative sugar transporters of the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae: their 
      phylogeny and role for nutrient supply in larval defensive glands.
PG  - e84461
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0084461 [doi]
LID - e84461
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phytophagous insects have emerged successfully on the planet also 
      because of the development of diverse and often astonishing defensive strategies 
      against their enemies. The larvae of the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae, 
      for example, secrete deterrents from specialized defensive glands on their back. The 
      secretion process involves ATP-binding cassette transporters. Therefore, sugar as 
      one of the major energy sources to fuel the ATP synthesis for the cellular 
      metabolism and transport processes, has to be present in the defensive glands. 
      However, the role of sugar transporters for the production of defensive secretions 
      was not addressed until now. RESULTS: To identify sugar transporters in P. 
      cochleariae, a transcript catalogue was created by Illumina sequencing of cDNA 
      libraries. A total of 68,667 transcripts were identified and 68 proteins were 
      annotated as either members of the solute carrier 2 (SLC2) family or trehalose 
      transporters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extension of the mammalian GLUT6/8 
      class in insects as well as one group of transporters exhibiting distinctive 
      conserved motifs only present in the insect order Coleoptera. RNA-seq data of 
      samples derived from the defensive glands revealed six transcripts encoding sugar 
      transporters with more than 3,000 counts. Two of them are exclusively expressed in 
      the glandular tissue. Reduction in secretions production was accomplished by 
      silencing two of four selected transporters. RNA-seq experiments of 
      transporter-silenced larvae showed the down-regulation of the silenced transporter 
      but concurrently the up-regulation of other SLC2 transporters suggesting an adaptive 
      system to maintain sugar homeostasis in the defensive glands. CONCLUSION: We provide 
      the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of the SLC2 family in a phytophagous 
      beetle species. RNAi and RNA-seq experiments underline the importance of SLC2 
      transporters in defensive glands to achieve a chemical defense for successful 
      competitive interaction in natural ecosystems.

      specificities for Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins are insecticidal proteins used widely for pest 
      control. They are lethal to a restricted range of insects via specific interactions 
      with insect receptors such as the ABC transporter subfamily members C2 (ABCC2) and 
      C3 (ABCC3). However, it is still unclear how these different receptors contribute to 
      insect susceptibility to Cry1A toxins. Here, we investigated the differences between 
      the silkworm (Bombyx mori) ABCC2 (BmABCC2_S) and ABCC3 (BmABCC3) receptors in 
      mediating Cry toxicity. Compared with BmABCC2_S, BmABCC3 exhibited 80- and 267-fold 
      lower binding affinities to Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab, respectively, and these decreased 
      affinities correlated well with the lower receptor activities of BmABCC3 for these 
      Cry1A toxins. To identify the amino acid residues responsible for these differences, 
      we constructed BmABCC3 variants containing a partial amino acid replacement with 
      extracellular loops (ECLs) from BmABCC2_S. Replacing three amino acids from ECL 1 or 
      3 increased BmABCC3 activity toward Cry1Aa and enabled its activity toward Cry1Ab. 
      Meanwhile, BmABCC2_S and BmABCC3 exhibited no receptor activities for Cry1Ca, 
      Cry1Da, and Cry3Bb, correlating with markedly lower binding affinities for these Cry 
      toxins. ABCC2 from a Cry1Ab-resistant B. mori strain (BmABCC2_R), which has a 
      tyrosine insertion in ECL 2, displayed 93-fold lower binding affinity to Cry1Ab 
      compared with BmABCC2_S but maintained high binding affinity to Cry1Aa. These 
      results indicate that the Cry toxin-binding affinities of ABCC transporters are 
      largely linked to the level of Cry susceptibility of ABCC-expressing cells and that 
      the ABCC ECL structures determine the specificities to Cry toxins.

TI  - A reexamination on the deficiency of riboflavin accumulation in Malpighian tubules 
      in larval translucent mutants of the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
PG  - 425-431
LID - 10.1007/s10709-018-0034-y [doi]
AB  - A variety of insects accumulate high contents of riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) in their 
      Malpighian tubules (MTs). Although this process is known to be genetically 
      controlled, the mechanism is not known. In the 1940s and the 1950s, several studies 
      showed that riboflavin contents were low in the MTs of some Bombyx mori (silkworm) 
      mutants with translucent larval skin mutations (e.g., w-3, od, oa, and otm) and that 
      genes responsible for these translucent mutations also affected riboflavin 
      accumulation in the MTs. Since the 2000s, it has been shown that the w-3 gene 
      encodes an ABC transporter, whereas genes responsible for od, oa, and otm mutations 
      encode for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. These findings suggest 
      that some genes of ABC transporters and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles 
      may control the accumulation of riboflavin in MTs. Therefore, we reexamined the 
      effects that translucent mutations have on the accumulation of riboflavin in MTs by 
      using the translucent and wild-type segregants in mutant strains to measure the 
      specific effect that each gene has on riboflavin accumulation (independent of 
      genomic background). We used nine translucent mutations (w-3(oe), oa, od, otm, Obs, 
      oy, or, oh, and obt) even though the genes responsible for some of these mutations 
      (Obs, oy, or, oh, and obt) have not yet been isolated. Through observation of larval 
      MTs and measurements of riboflavin content using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography, we found that the oa, od, otm, and or mutations were responsible for 
      low contents of riboflavin in MTs, whereas the Obs and oy mutations did not affect 
      riboflavin accumulation. This indicates that the molecular mechanism for riboflavin 
      accumulation is similar but somewhat different than the mechanism responsible for 
      uric acid accumulation in epidermal cells. We found that the genes responsible for 
      oa, od, and otm mutations were consistent with those already established for uric 
      acid accumulation in larval epidermis. This suggests that these three genes control 
      riboflavin accumulation in MTs through a mechanism similar to that of uric acid 
      accumulation, although we do not yet know why the or mutation also controls 
      riboflavin accumulation.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent a superfamily of proteins that 
      have important physiological roles in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In insects, 
      ABC transporters have previously been implicated in insecticide resistance. The 91-R 
      strain of Drosophila melanogaster has been intensely selected with DDT over six 
      decades. A recent selective sweeps analysis of 91-R implicated the potential role of 
      MDR49, an ABC transporter, in DDT resistance, however, to date the details of how 
      MDR49 may play a role in resistance have not been elucidated. In this study, we 
      investigated the impact of structural changes and an alternative splicing event in 
      MDR49 on DDT-resistance in 91-R, as compared to the DDT susceptible strain 91-C. We 
      observed three amino acid differences in MDR49 when 91-R was compared with 91-C, and 
      only one isoform (MDR49B) was implicated in DDT resistance. A transgenic Drosophila 
      strain containing the 91-R-MDR49B isoform had a significantly higher LD50 value as 
      compared to the 91-C-MDR49B isoform at the early time points (6 h to 12 h) during 
      DDT exposure. Our data support the hypothesis that the MDR49B isoform, with three 
      amino acid mutations, plays a role in the early aspects of DDT resistance in 91-R.

TI  - Transcriptome profiling of whitefly guts in response to Tomato yellow leaf curl 
      virus infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant viruses in agricultural crops are of great concern worldwide, and 
      over 75% of them are transmitted from infected to healthy plants by insect vectors. 
      Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a begomovirus, which is the largest and 
      most economically important group of plant viruses, transmitted by the whitefly 
      Bemisia tabaci. The circulation of TYLCV in the insect involves complex insect-virus 
      interactions, whereas the molecular mechanisms of these interactions remain 
      ambiguous. The insect gut as a barrier for viral entry and dissemination is thought 
      to regulate the vector specificity. However, due to its tiny size, information for 
      the responses of whitefly gut to virus infection is limited. METHODS: We 
      investigated the transcriptional response of the gut of B. tabaci Middle East-Asia 
      Minor 1 species to TYLCV infection using Illumina sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 
      5207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between viruliferous and non-viruliferous 
      whitefly guts were identified. Enrichment analyses showed that cargo receptor and 
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were enriched in DEGs, and might help the 
      virus to cross gut barrier. TYLCV could perturb cell cycle and DNA repair as a 
      possible result of its replication in the whitefly. Our data also demonstrated that 
      TYLCV can activate whitefly defense responses, such as antimicrobial peptides. 
      Meanwhile, a number of genes involved in intracellular signaling were activated by 
      TYLCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the complex insect-virus 
      relationship in whitefly gut and provide substantial molecular information for the 
      role of insect midguts in virus transmission.

TI  - Metabolic Characterisation of the Midgut of Bombyx mori Varieties after BmNPV 
      Infection Using GC-MS-Based Metabolite Profiling.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21134707 [doi]
LID - 4707
AB  - Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a silkworm disease that is especially 
      harmful to cocoon production and seriously restricts sericultural development. Our 
      laboratory successfully cultivated a new highly BmNPV-resistant silkworm variety, 
      Huakang 2; however, its mechanism of BmNPV resistance remains unclear. To understand 
      its resistance mechanism, we conducted a metabolomic and transcriptomic study of the 
      midgut of silkworm varieties, Baiyu N and Baiyu after BmNPV infection. We identified 
      451 differential metabolites, which were mostly comprised of small molecules, such 
      as saccharides, acids, amines, alcohols, and glycosides. We found that the primary 
      differences in disease resistance between the silkworm varieties are 
      metabolic-pathways, tryptophan metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, 
      ABC-transporters, beta-alanine metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism. Combined 
      analysis with transcriptomic data suggested that tryptophan metabolism and oxidative 
      phosphorylation are closely related to the silkworms' BmNPV resistance. We 
      hypothesize that the roles of the two metabolic pathways in the BmNPV resistance 
      mechanism might be the following: Oxidative phosphorylation generates a large amount

      the energy required for establishing BmNPV resistance. Tryptophan metabolism then 
      activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) through the exogenous virus BmNPV, 
      which activates the silkworm's immune system to defeat BmNPV infections.

AB  - Malpighian tubules, analogous to vertebrate nephrons, play a key role in insect 
      osmoregulation and detoxification. Tubules can become infected with a protozoan, 
      Malpighamoeba, which damages their epithelial cells, potentially compromising their 
      function. Here we used a modified Ramsay assay to quantify the impact of 
      Malpighamoeba infection on fluid secretion and P-glycoprotein-dependent 
      detoxification by desert locust Malpighian tubules. Infected tubules have a greater 
      surface area and a higher fluid secretion rate than uninfected tubules. Infection 
      also impairs P-glycoprotein-dependent detoxification by reducing the net rhodamine 
      extrusion per surface area. However, due to the increased surface area and fluid 
      secretion rate, infected tubules have similar total net extrusion per tubule to 
      uninfected tubules. Increased fluid secretion rate of infected tubules likely 
      exposes locusts to greater water stress and increased energy costs. Coupled with 
      reduced efficiency of P-glycoprotein detoxification per surface area, Malpighamoeba 
      infection is likely to reduce insect survival in natural environments.

TI  - Gene silencing through RNAi and antisense Vivo-Morpholino increases the efficacy of 
      pyrethroids on larvae of Anopheles stephensi.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insecticides are still at the core of insect pest and vector control 
      programmes. Several lines of evidence indicate that ABC transporters are involved in 
      detoxification processes against insecticides, including permethrin and other 
      pyrethroids. In particular, the ABCG4 gene, a member of the G subfamily, has 
      consistently been shown to be up-regulated in response to insecticide treatments in 
      the mosquito malaria vector Anopheles stephensi (both adults and larvae). METHODS: 
      To verify the actual involvement of this transmembrane protein in the detoxification 
      process of permethrin, bioassays on larvae of An. stephensi, combining the 
      insecticide with a siRNA, specifically designed for the inhibition of ABCG4 gene 
      expression were performed. Administration to larvae of the same siRNA, labeled with 
      a fluorescent molecule, was effected to investigate the systemic distribution of the 
      inhibitory RNA into the larval bodies. Based on siRNA results, similar experiments 
      using antisense Vivo-Morpholinos (Vivo-MOs) were effected. These molecules, compared 
      to siRNA, are expected to guarantee a higher stability in environmental conditions 
      and in the insect gut, and present thus a higher potential for future in-field 
      applications. RESULTS: Bioassays using two different concentrations of siRNA, 
      associated with permethrin, led to an increase of larval mortality, compared with 
      results with permethrin alone. These outcomes confirm that ABCG4 transporter plays a 
      role in the detoxification process against the selected insecticide. Moreover, after 
      fluorescent labelling, it was shown the systemic dissemination of siRNA in different 
      body districts of An. stephensi larvae, which suggest a potential systemic effect of 
      the molecule. At the same time, results of Vivo-MO experiments were congruent with 
      those obtained using siRNA, thus confirming the potential of ABCG4 inhibition as a 
      strategy to increase permethrin susceptibility in mosquitoes. For the first time, 
      Vivo-MOs were administered in water to larvae, with evidence for a biological 
      effect. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting ABCG4 gene for silencing through both techniques 
      resulted in an increased pyrethroid efficacy. These results open the way toward the 
      possibility to exploit ABCG4 inhibition in the context of integrated programmes for 
      the control An. stephensi mosquitoes and malaria transmission.

TI  - Ribociclib shows potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions being a 
      substrate of ABCB1 and potent inhibitor of ABCB1, ABCG2 and CYP450 isoforms in 
      vitro.
PG  - 10-17

LID - 10.1016/j.bcp.2018.04.013 [doi]
AB  - Ribociclib is a novel cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 selective inhibitor that 
      recently gained breakthrough therapy status and global approval for advanced breast 
      cancer treatment. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters may become a site of 
      severe drug interactions and a mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) development. 
      With respect to rapid progress of ribociclib in the clinical field, we aimed to 
      identify its interactions with ABC transporters and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 
      and evaluate its potential to overcome transporter-mediated MDR using established in 
      vitro methods. Our data showed accelerated ABCB1 inhibitor LY335979-sensitive, 
      basolateral-to-apical transport of ribociclib across MDCKII-ABCB1 cell monolayers, 
      which identified ribociclib as an ABCB1 substrate. The antiproliferative studies 
      supported this finding by demonstrating significantly higher EC(50) value in ABCB1-, 
      but not ABCG2- or ABCC1-expressing MDCKII cells, than in the parent MDCKII cell 
      line. Furthermore, we observed significant inhibitory effects of ribociclib on ABCB1 
      and ABCG2 transporters and CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C9 isoform activity in 
      human CYP-expressing insect microsomes. The ribociclib-induced ABCB1 and ABCG2 
      inhibition further reversed daunorubicin and mitoxantrone resistance in MDCKII and 
      human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines, indicating a synergistic antiproliferative 
      effect, without affecting ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression. In summary, our data indicate 
      that ABCB1 affects ribociclib transport across the membranes and the high potential 
      of ribociclib for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) through ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters 
      and CYP isoforms. Moreover, we demonstrate the beneficial MDR-reversing potential of 
      ribociclib, which could be further exploited in novel anticancer treatment 
      strategies.

TI  - Systematic identification and functional analysis of long non-coding RNAs involved 
      in indoxacarb resistance in Spodoptera litura.
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.13015 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding transcripts that are more than 200 
      nucleotides long. They play essential roles in regulating a variety of biological 
      processes in many species, including insects, and some lncRNAs have been found to be 
      associated with insecticide resistance. However, the characteristics and biological 
      functions of lncRNAs involved in indoxacarb resistance are unknown in Spodoptera 
      litura. We performed RNA sequencing in the SS, InRS, and FInRS of S. litura and 
      identified 11 978 lncRNAs, including 3136 intergenic lncRNAs, 7393 intronic lncRNAs, 
      and 1449 anti-sense lncRNAs. Compared with the SS, 51 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 
      134 lncRNAs were down-regulated in the two resistant strains, and 908 differentially 
      expressed mRNAs were predicted as the target genes of the 185 differentially 
      expressed lncRNAs. Further analysis showed that 112 of differentially expressed 
      lncRNAs may be associated with indoxacarb resistance by regulating the expression of 
      14 P450s, 7 CCEs, 1 GSTs, 6 UGTs, 5 ABC transporters and 24 cuticle protein genes, 
      and 79 of differentially expressed lncRNAs may regulate the expression of 14 
      detoxification genes and 19 cuticle protein genes to participate in indoxacarb 
      resistance by sponging 10 microRNAs. Interestingly, 47 of differentially expressed 
      lncRNAs may mediate indoxacarb resistance through both lncRNA-mRNA and 
      lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways. Furthermore, quantitative PCR, RNA

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) is the largest transporter gene family and the genes 
      play key roles in xenobiotic resistance, metabolism, and development of all phyla. 
      However, the specific functions of ABC gene families in insects is unclear. We 
      report a genome-wide identification, phylogenetic, and transcriptional analysis of 
      the ABC genes in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). We identified 
      a total of 47 ABC genes (BdABCs) from the transcriptomic and genomic databases of B. 
      dorsalis and classified these genes into eight subfamilies (A-H), including 7 ABCAs, 
      7 ABCBs, 9 ABCCs, 2 ABCDs, 1 ABCE, 3 ABCFs, 15 ABCGs, and 3 ABCHs. Comparative 
      phylogenetic analysis of the ABCs suggests an orthologous relationship between B. 
      dorsalis and other insect species in which these genes have been related to 
      pesticide resistance and essential biological processes. Comparison of transcriptome 
      and relative expression patterns of BdABCs indicated diverse multifunctions within 
      different B. dorsalis tissues. The expression of 4, 10, and 14 BdABCs from 18 BdABCs 
      was significantly upregulated after exposure to LD(50)s of malathion, avermectin, 
      and beta-cypermethrin, respectively. The maximum expression level of most BdABCs 
      (including BdABCFs, BdABCGs, and BdABCHs) occurred at 48h post exposures, whereas 
      BdABCEs peaked at 24h after treatment. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated 
      suppression of BdABCB7 resulted in increased toxicity of malathion against B. 
      dorsalis. These data suggest that ABC transporter genes might play key roles in 
      xenobiotic metabolism and biosynthesis in B. dorsalis.

AB  - The crustacean Daphnia magna is an important model in multi-disciplinary scientific 
      fields such as genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, toxicology, and 
      ecology. Recently, the draft genome sequence and transcriptome data became publicly 
      available for this species. Genetic transformation has also been achieved via the 
      introduction of plasmid DNA into the genome. The identification of a screenable 
      marker gene and generation of mutant strains are essential to further advance D. 
      magna functional genomics. Because crustaceans are closely related to insects, we 
      hypothesized that, similar to Drosophila genetic studies, eye color-related genes 
      can function as marker genes in Daphnia. We searched orthologs of Drosophila eye 
      pigment transporters White, Scarlet, and Brown in the genome of D. magna. Amino acid 
      sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that D. magna has six white 
      and one scarlet orthologs, but lacks the brown ortholog. Due to the multiplicity of 
      white orthologs, we analyzed the function of the scarlet ortholog, DapmaSt, using 
      RNA interference. DapmaSt RNAi embryos showed disappearance of black pigments both 
      in the compound eye and in the ocellus, suggesting that DapmaSt is necessary for 
      black pigmentation in Daphnia eyes. To disrupt DapmaSt using the Crispr/Cas9 system, 
      we co-injected DapmaSt-targeting gRNAs with Cas9 mRNAs into eggs and established 
      white-eyed DapmaSt mutant lines that lack eye pigments throughout their lifespan. 
      Our results suggest that DapmaSt can be used as a transformation marker in D. magna 
      and the DapmaSt mutants would be an important resource for genetic transformation of 
      this species in the future.

TI  - Yersiniabactin contributes to overcoming zinc restriction during Yersinia pestis

LID - e2104073118
AB  - Yersinia pestis causes human plague and colonizes both a mammalian host and a flea 
      vector during its transmission cycle. A key barrier to bacterial infection is the 
      host's ability to actively sequester key biometals (e.g., iron, zinc, and manganese) 
      required for bacterial growth. This is referred to as nutritional immunity. 
      Mechanisms to overcome nutritional immunity are essential virulence factors for 
      bacterial pathogens. Y. pestis produces an iron-scavenging siderophore called 
      yersiniabactin (Ybt) that is required to overcome iron-mediated nutritional immunity 
      and cause lethal infection. Recently, Ybt has been shown to bind to zinc, and in the 
      absence of the zinc transporter ZnuABC, Ybt improves Y. pestis growth in 
      zinc-limited medium. These data suggest that, in addition to iron acquisition, Ybt 
      may also contribute to overcoming zinc-mediated nutritional immunity. To test this 
      hypothesis, we used a mouse model defective in iron-mediated nutritional immunity to 
      demonstrate that Ybt contributes to virulence in an iron-independent manner. 
      Furthermore, using a combination of bacterial mutants and mice defective in 
      zinc-mediated nutritional immunity, we identified calprotectin as the primary 
      barrier for Y. pestis to acquire zinc during infection and that Y. pestis uses Ybt 
      to compete with calprotectin for zinc. Finally, we discovered that Y. pestis 
      encounters zinc limitation within the flea midgut, and Ybt contributes to overcoming 
      this limitation. Together, these results demonstrate that Ybt is a bona fide zinc 
      acquisition mechanism used by Y. pestis to surmount zinc limitation during the 
      infection of both the mammalian and insect hosts.

TI  - Transcriptional profile and differential fitness in a specialist milkweed insect 
      across host plants varying in toxicity.
PG  - 6742-6761
LID - 10.1111/mec.14401 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between plants and herbivorous insects have been models for theories of 
      specialization and co-evolution for over a century. Phytochemicals govern many 
      aspects of these interactions and have fostered the evolution of adaptations by 
      insects to tolerate or even specialize on plant defensive chemistry. While genomic 
      approaches are providing new insights into the genes and mechanisms insect 
      specialists employ to tolerate plant secondary metabolites, open questions remain 
      about the evolution and conservation of insect counterdefences, how insects respond 
      to the diversity defences mounted by their host plants, and the costs and benefits 
      of resistance and tolerance to plant defences in natural ecological communities. 
      Using a milkweed-specialist aphid (Aphis nerii) model, we test the effects of host 
      plant species with increased toxicity, likely driven primarily by increased 
      secondary metabolites, on aphid life history traits and whole-body gene expression. 
      We show that more toxic plant species have a negative effect on aphid development 
      and lifetime fecundity. When feeding on more toxic host plants with higher levels of 
      secondary metabolites, aphids regulate a narrow, targeted set of genes, including 
      those involved in canonical detoxification processes (e.g., cytochrome P450s, 
      hydrolases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and ABC transporters). These results 
      indicate that A. nerii marshal a variety of metabolic detoxification mechanisms to 
      circumvent milkweed toxicity and facilitate host plant specialization, yet, despite 
      these detoxification mechanisms, aphids experience reduced fitness when feeding on 
      more toxic host plants. Disentangling how specialist insects respond to challenging 
      host plants is a pivotal step in understanding the evolution of specialized diet 
      breadths.

AB  - Endogenous circadian rhythms are thought to modulate responses to external factors, 
      but mechanisms that confer time-of-day differences in organismal responses to 
      environmental insults/therapeutic treatments are poorly understood. Using a 
      xenobiotic, we find that permeability of the Drosophila "blood"-brain barrier (BBB) 
      is higher at night. The permeability rhythm is driven by circadian regulation of 
      efflux and depends on a molecular clock in the perineurial glia of the BBB, although 
      efflux transporters are restricted to subperineurial glia (SPG). We show that 
      transmission of circadian signals across the layers requires cyclically expressed 
      gap junctions. Specifically, during nighttime, gap junctions reduce intracellular 
      magnesium ([Mg(2+)]i), a positive regulator of efflux, in SPG. Consistent with lower 
      nighttime efflux, nighttime administration of the anti-epileptic phenytoin is more 
      effective at treating a Drosophila seizure model. These findings identify a novel 
      mechanism of circadian regulation and have therapeutic implications for drugs 
      targeted to the central nervous system.

AB  - The human genome harbors just 20,000 genes suggesting that the variety of possible 
      protein products per gene plays a significant role in generating functional 
      diversity. In bottom-up proteomics peptides are mapped back to proteins and 
      proteoforms to describe a proteome; however, accurate quantitation of proteoforms is 
      challenging due to incomplete protein sequence coverage and mapping ambiguities. 
      Here, we demonstrate that a new software tool called ProteinClusterQuant (PCQ) can 
      be used to deduce the presence of proteoforms that would have otherwise been missed, 
      as exemplified in a proteomic comparison of two fly species, Drosophila melanogaster 
      and D. virilis. PCQ was used to identify reduced levels of serine/threonine protein 
      kinases PKN1 and PKN4 in CFBE41o(-) cells compared to HBE41o(-) cells and to 
      elucidate that shorter proteoforms of full-length caspase-4 and ephrin B receptor 
      are differentially expressed. Thus, PCQ extends current analyses in quantitative 
      proteomics and facilitates finding differentially regulated proteins and 
      proteoforms.

AB  - ABCG2 (BCRP - breast cancer resistance protein) belongs to the ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) superfamily. It plays an important role in the disposition and elimination of 
      xeno- and endobiotics and/or their metabolites in mammals. Likewise, the protective 
      role of ABC transporters, including Abcg2, has been reported for aquatic organisms. 
      In our previous study we have cloned the full gene sequence of rainbow trout 
      (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Abcg2a and showed its high expression in liver and primary 
      hepatocytes. Based on those insights, the main goal of this study was to perform a 
      detailed functional characterization of trout Abcg2a using insect ovary cells 
      (Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9) as a heterologous expression system. Membrane vesicles 
      preparations from Sf9 cells were used for the ATPase assay determinations and basic 
      biochemical properties of fish Abcg2a versus human ABCG2 have been compared. A 
      series of 39 physiologically and/or environmentally relevant substances was then 
      tested on interaction with trout Abcg2a and human ABCG2. Correlation analysis 
      reveals highly similar pattern of activation and inhibition. Significant activation 
      of trout Abcg2a ATPase was observed for prazosin, doxorubicine, sildenafil, 
      furosemid, propranolol, fenofibrate and pheophorbide. Pesticides showed either a 
      weak activation (malathione) or strong (endosulfan) to weak (chlorpyrifos, 
      fenoxycarb, DDE) inhibition of trout Abcg2a ATPase while the highest activation was 
      obtained for benzo(a)pyrene, curcumine and testosterone. In conclusion, data from 
      this study offer the first characterization of fish Abcg2a, reveal potent 
      interactors among physiologically or environmentally relevant substances and point 
      to similarities regarding strengths and interactor preferences between human ABCG2 
      and fish Abcg2a.

AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins belong to the B subfamily of the ATP Binding 
      Cassette (ABC) transporters, which export a wide range of compounds including 
      pharmaceuticals. In this study, we used reverse genetics to study the role of all 
      seven Plasmodium MDR proteins during the life cycle of malaria parasites. Four P. 
      berghei genes (encoding MDR1, 4, 6 and 7) were refractory to deletion, indicating a 
      vital role during blood stage multiplication and validating them as potential 
      targets for antimalarial drugs. Mutants lacking expression of MDR2, MDR3 and MDR5 
      were generated in both P. berghei and P. falciparum, indicating a dispensable role 
      for blood stage development. Whereas P. berghei mutants lacking MDR3 and MDR5 had a 
      reduced blood stage multiplication in vivo, blood stage growth of P. falciparum 
      mutants in vitro was not significantly different. Oocyst maturation and sporozoite 
      formation in Plasmodium mutants lacking MDR2 or MDR5 was reduced. Sporozoites of 
      these P. berghei mutants were capable of infecting mice and life cycle completion, 
      indicating the absence of vital roles during liver stage development. Our results 
      demonstrate vital and dispensable roles of MDR proteins during blood stages and an 
      important function in sporogony for MDR2 and MDR5 in both Plasmodium species.

LID - 10.1042/BCJ20190736 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-binding cassette transporter associated with multidrug 
      resistance in cancer cells, is capable of effluxing a number of xenobiotics as well 
      as anticancer drugs. The transport of molecules through the transmembrane (TM) 
      region of P-gp involves orchestrated conformational changes between inward-open and 
      inward-closed forms, the details of which are still being worked out. Here, we 
      assessed how the binding of transport substrates or modulators in the TM region and 
      the binding of ATP to the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) affect the 
      thermostability of P-gp in a membrane environment. P-gp stability after exposure at 
      high temperatures (37-80°C) was assessed by measuring ATPase activity and loss of 
      monomeric P-gp. Our results show that P-gp is significantly thermostabilized (>22°C 
      higher IT50) by the binding of ATP under non-hydrolyzing conditions (in the absence 
      of Mg2+). By using an ATP-binding-deficient mutant (Y401A) and a 
      hydrolysis-deficient mutant (E556Q/E1201Q), we show that thermostabilization of P-gp 
      requires binding of ATP to both NBDs and their dimerization. Additionally, we found 
      that transport substrates do not affect the thermal stability of P-gp either in the 
      absence or presence of ATP; in contrast, inhibitors of P-gp including tariquidar and 
      zosuquidar prevent ATP-dependent thermostabilization in a concentration-dependent 
      manner, by stabilizing the inward-open conformation. Altogether, our data suggest 
      that modulators, which bind in the TM regions, inhibit ATP hydrolysis and drug 
      transport by preventing the ATP-dependent dimerization of the NBDs of P-gp.

      resistance to Bt toxin Cry2Ab.

AB  - Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) have many benefits and are important globally for managing insect 
      pests. However, the evolution of pest resistance to Bt crops reduces their benefits. 
      Understanding the genetic basis of such resistance is needed to better monitor, 
      manage, and counter pest resistance to Bt crops. Previous work shows that resistance 
      to Bt toxin Cry2Ab is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the ATP-binding 
      cassette protein ABCA2 in lab- and field-selected populations of the pink bollworm 
      (Pectinophora gossypiella), one of the world's most destructive pests of cotton. 
      Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the hypothesis that mutations in the 
      pink bollworm gene encoding ABCA2 (PgABCA2) can cause resistance to Cry2Ab. 
      Consistent with this hypothesis, introduction of disruptive mutations in PgABCA2 in 
      a susceptible strain of pink bollworm increased the frequency of resistance to 
      Cry2Ab and facilitated creation of a Cry2Ab-resistant strain. All Cry2Ab-resistant 
      individuals tested in this study had disruptive mutations in PgABCA2. Overall, we 
      found 17 different disruptive mutations in PgABCA2 gDNA and 26 in PgABCA2 cDNA, 
      including novel mutations corresponding precisely to single-guide (sgRNA) sites used 
      for CRISPR/Cas9. Together with previous results, these findings provide the first 
      case of practical resistance to Cry2Ab where evidence identifies a specific gene in 
      which disruptive mutations can cause resistance and are associated with resistance 
      in field-selected populations.

TI  - Spatial patterning of scent in petunia corolla is discriminated by bees and involves 
      the ABCG1 transporter.
PG  - 1746-1758
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15269 [doi]
AB  - Floral guides are patterned cues that direct the pollinator to the plant 
      reproductive organs. The spatial distribution of showy visual and olfactory traits 
      allows efficient plant-pollinator interactions. Data on the mechanisms underlying 
      floral volatile patterns or their interactions with pollinators are lacking. Here we 
      characterize the spatial emission patterns of volatiles from the corolla of the 
      model plant Petunia × hybrida and reveal the ability of honeybees to distinguish 
      these patterns. Along the adaxial epidermis, in correlation with cell density, the 
      petal base adjacent to reproductive organs emitted significantly higher levels of 
      volatiles than the distal petal rim. Volatile emission could also be differentiated 
      between the two epidermal surfaces: emission from the adaxial side was significantly 
      higher than that from the abaxial side. Similar emission patterns were also observed 
      in other petunias, Dianthus caryophyllus (carnation) and Argyranthemum frutescens 
      (Marguerite daisy). Analyses of transcripts involved in volatile production/emission 
      revealed lower levels of the plasma-membrane transporter ABCG1 in the abaxial versus 
      adaxial epidermis. Transient overexpression of ABCG1 enhanced emission from the 
      abaxial epidermis to the level of the adaxial epidermis, suggesting its involvement 
      in spatial emission patterns in the epidermal layers. Proboscis extension response 
      experiments showed that differences in emission levels along the adaxial epidermis, 
      that is, petal base versus rim, detected by GC-MS are also discernible by honeybees.

TI  - Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporter Mdr49-like confers resistance to 
      imidacloprid in the field populations of brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.
PG  - 579-590
LID - 10.1002/ps.6666 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is the most 
      severe pest attacking rice crops using sucking mouthparts. It causes significant 
      damages to rice growth and food production worldwide. With the long-term and wide 
      use of insecticides, field populations of BPH have developed resistance to many 
      insecticides. RESULTS: Here, we showed that upregulation of an ATP-binding cassette 
      transporter gene NlMdr49-like contributes to imidacloprid resistance in field 
      populations of BPH. A comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to evaluate 
      the gene expression in two field populations (JXSG18 and YNTC18). Compared with a 
      susceptible strain (Sus), 202 upregulated genes and 170 downregulated genes were 
      identified in both field populations. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that 
      the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are mainly linked to metabolic process and 
      transmembrane transport. Among the candidate DEGs, NlMdr49-like was significantly 
      upregulated in both field populations. Based on the genome and transcriptome of BPH, 
      the full-length complementary DNA of NlMdr49-like was sequenced and its molecular 
      characteristics were analyzed. Expression pattern analysis of various tissues showed 
      that NlMdr49-like was predominantly expressed in midgut and Malpighian tubules which 
      are important excretion organs. Knocking down NlMdr49-like reduced BPH resistance to 
      imidacloprid, but did not affect its resistance to the other nine insecticides 
      (chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, nitenpyram, dinotefuran, sulfoxaflor, triflumezopyrim, 
      ethiprole, buprofezin and pymetrozine). Furthermore, a transgenic strain of 
      Drosophila melanogaster overexpressing NlMdr49-like was less susceptible to 
      imidacloprid. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that upregulation of NlMdr49-like 
      is another mechanism contributing to imidacloprid resistance in N. lugens. This 
      result is helpful to further understand the resistance mechanism of N. lugens to 
      imidacloprid. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Roles of Efflux Pumps from Different Superfamilies in the Surface-Associated 
      Motility and Virulence of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978.
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02190-18 [doi]
LID - e02190-18
AB  - Although the relationship between Acinetobacter baumannii efflux pumps and 
      antimicrobial resistance is well documented, less is known about the involvement of 
      these proteins in the pathogenicity of this nosocomial pathogen. In previous work, 
      we identified the AbaQ major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pump and 
      demonstrated its participation in the motility and virulence of A. baumannii In the 
      present study, we examined the role in these processes of A. baumannii transporters 
      belonging to different superfamilies of efflux pumps. Genes encoding known or 
      putative permeases belonging to efflux pump superfamilies other than the MFS were 
      selected, and the corresponding knockouts were constructed. The antimicrobial 
      susceptibilities of these mutants were consistent with previously reported data. In 
      mutants of A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978 carrying inactivated genes encoding the 
      efflux pumps A1S_2736 (resistance nodulation division [RND]), A1S_3371 (multidrug 
      and toxic compound extrusion [MATE]), and A1S_0710 (small multidrug resistance 
      [SMR]), as well as the newly described ATP-binding cassette (ABC) permeases A1S_1242 
      and A1S_2622, both surface-associated motility and virulence were reduced compared 
      to the parental strain. However, inactivation of the genes encoding the known ABC 
      permeases A1S_0536 and A1S_1535, the newly identified putative ABC permeases 
      A1S_0027 and A1S_1057, or the proteobacterial antimicrobial compound efflux (PACE) 
      transporters A1S_1503 and A1S_2063 had no effects on bacterial motility or 
      virulence. Our results demonstrate the involvement of antimicrobial transporters 
      belonging at least to five of the six known efflux pump superfamilies in both 
      surface-associated motility and virulence in A. baumannii ATCC 17978.

TI  - Characterization of the Lipidome and Biophysical Properties of Membranes from High 
      Five Insect Cells Expressing Mouse P-Glycoprotein.
LID - 10.3390/biom11030426 [doi]
LID - 426
AB  - The lipid composition of biomembranes influences the properties of the lipid bilayer 
      and that of the proteins. In this study, the lipidome and the lipid/protein ratio of 
      membranes from High Five™ insect cells overexpressing mouse P-glycoprotein was 
      characterized. This provides a better understanding of the lipid environment in 
      which P-glycoprotein is embedded, and thus of its functional and structural 
      properties. The relative abundance of the distinct phospholipid classes and their 
      acyl chain composition was characterized. A mass ratio of 0.57 ± 0.11 phospholipids 
      to protein was obtained. Phosphatidylethanolamines are the most abundant 
      phospholipids, followed by phosphatidylcholines. Membranes are also enriched in 
      negatively charged lipids (phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols and 
      phosphatidylglycerols), and contain small amounts of sphingomyelins, ceramides and 
      monoglycosilatedceramides. The most abundant acyl chains are monounsaturated, with 
      significant amounts of saturated chains. The characterization of the phospholipids 
      by HPLC-MS allowed identification of the combination of acyl chains, with 
      palmitoyl-oleoyl being the most representative for all major phospholipid classes 
      except for phosphatidylserines, which are mostly saturated. A mixture of 
      POPE:POPC:POPS in the ratio 45:35:20 is proposed for the preparation of simple 
      representative model membranes. The adequacy of the model membranes was further 
      evaluated by characterizing their surface potential and fluidity.

AB  - The multidrug resistance protein MRP1 is an ATP-driven pump that confers resistance 
      to chemotherapy. Previously, we have shown that intracellular substrates are 
      recruited to a bipartite binding site when the transporter rests in an inward-facing 
      conformation. A key question remains: how are high-affinity substrates transferred 
      across the membrane and released outside the cell? Using electron cryomicroscopy, we 
      show here that ATP binding opens the transport pathway to the extracellular space 
      and reconfigures the substrate-binding site such that it relinquishes its affinity 
      for substrate. Thus, substrate is released prior to ATP hydrolysis. With this 
      result, we now have a complete description of the conformational cycle that enables 
      substrate transfer in a eukaryotic ABC exporter.

TI  - De novo transcriptome analysis and identification of genes associated with immunity, 
      detoxification and energy metabolism from the fat body of the tephritid gall fly, 
      Procecidochares utilis.
PG  - e0226039

LID - e0226039
AB  - The fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the liver and fat tissue of 
      vertebrates, plays an important role in insect life cycles. The fat body is involved 
      in protein storage, energy metabolism, elimination of xenobiotics, and production of 
      immunity regulator-like proteins. However, the molecular mechanism of the fat body's 
      physiological functions in the tephritid stem gall-forming fly, Procecidochares 
      utilis, are still unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the 
      fat body of P. utilis using Illumina sequencing technology. In total, 3.71 G of 
      clean reads were obtained and assembled into 30,559 unigenes, with an average length 
      of 539 bp. Among those unigenes, 21,439 (70.16%) were annotated based on sequence 
      similarity to proteins in NCBI's non-redundant protein sequence database (Nr). 
      Sequences were also compared to NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide sequence database 
      (Nt), a manually curated and reviewed protein sequence database (SwissProt), and 
      KEGG and gene ontology annotations were applied to better understand the functions 
      of these unigenes. A comparative analysis was performed to identify unigenes related 
      to detoxification, immunity and energy metabolism. Many unigenes involved in 
      detoxification were identified, including 50 unigenes of putative cytochrome P450s 
      (P450s), 18 of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 35 of carboxylesterases (CarEs) 
      and 26 of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Many unigenes related to immunity 
      were identified, including 17 putative serpin genes, five peptidoglycan recognition 
      proteins (PGRPs) and four lysozyme genes. In addition, unigenes potentially involved

AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF 
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common symptoms include 
      progressive lung disease and chronic digestive conditions. CF is the first human 
      genetic disease to benefit from having five different species of animal models. 
      Despite the phenotypic differences among the animal models and human CF, these 
      models have provided invaluable insight into understanding disease mechanisms at the 
      organ-system level. Here, we identify a member of the ABCC4 family, CG5789, that has 
      the structural and functional properties expected for encoding the Drosophila 
      equivalent of human CFTR, and thus refer to it as Drosophila CFTR (Dmel\CFTR). We 
      show that knockdown of Dmel\CFTR in the adult intestine disrupts osmotic homeostasis 
      and displays CF-like phenotypes that lead to intestinal stem cell hyperplasia. We 
      also show that expression of wild-type human CFTR, but not mutant variants of CFTR 
      that prevent plasma membrane expression, rescues the mutant phenotypes of Dmel\CFTR 
      Furthermore, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based transcriptomic analysis 
      using Dmel\CFTR fly intestine and identified a mucin gene, Muc68D, which is required 
      for proper intestinal barrier protection. Altogether, our findings suggest that 
      Drosophila can be a powerful model organism for studying CF pathophysiology.

TI  - Recently differentiated epimastigotes from Trypanosoma cruzi are infective to the 
      mammalian host.
PG  - 712-736
LID - 10.1111/mmi.13653 [doi]
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, has a complex life cycle 
      in which four distinct developmental forms alternate between the insect vector and 
      the mammalian host. It is assumed that replicating epimastigotes present in the 
      insect gut are not infective to mammalian host, a paradigm corroborated by the 
      widely acknowledged fact that only this stage is susceptible to the complement 
      system. In the present work, we establish a T. cruzi in vitro and in vivo 
      epimastigogenesis model to analyze the biological aspects of recently differentiated 
      epimastigotes (rdEpi). We show that both trypomastigote stages of T. cruzi 
      (cell-derived and metacyclic) are able to transform into epimastigotes (processes 
      termed primary and secondary epimastigogenesis, respectively) and that rdEpi have 
      striking properties in comparison to long-term cultured epimastigotes: resistance to 
      complement-mediated lysis and both in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (mouse) 
      infectivity. Proteomics analysis of all T. cruzi stages reveled a cluster of 
      proteins that were up-regulated only in rdEpi (including ABC transporters and ERO1), 
      suggesting a role for them in rdEpi virulence. The present work introduces a new 
      experimental model for the study of host-parasite interactions, showing that rdEpi 
      can be infective to the mammalian host.

TI  - Mutagenesis separates ATPase and thioesterase activities of the peroxisomal ABC 
      transporter, Comatose.
PG  - 10502
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-46685-9 [doi]
LID - 10502
AB  - The peroxisomal ABC transporter, Comatose (CTS), a full length transporter from 
      Arabidopsis has intrinsic acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT) activity, important for 
      physiological function. We used molecular modelling, mutagenesis and biochemical 
      analysis to identify amino acid residues important for ACOT activity. D863, Q864 and 
      T867 lie within transmembrane helix 9. These residues are orientated such that they 
      might plausibly contribute to a catalytic triad similar to type II Hotdog fold 
      thioesterases. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutation of these 
      residues to alanine resulted in defective of β-oxidation. All CTS mutants were 
      expressed and targeted to peroxisomes and retained substrate-stimulated ATPase 
      activity. When expressed in insect cell membranes, Q864A and S810N had similar 
      ATPase activity to wild type but greatly reduced ACOT activity, whereas the Walker A 
      mutant K487A had greatly reduced ATPase and no ATP-dependent ACOT activity. In wild 
      type CTS, ATPase but not ACOT was stimulated by non-cleavable C14 ether-CoA. ACOT 
      activity was stimulated by ATP but not by non-hydrolysable AMPPNP. Thus, ACOT 
      activity depends on functional ATPase activity but not vice versa, and these two 
      activities can be separated by mutagenesis. Whether D863, Q864 and T867 have a 
      catalytic role or play a more indirect role in NBD-TMD communication is discussed.

TI  - Unraveling the role of male reproductive tract and haemolymph in cantharidin-exuding 
      Lydus trimaculatus and Mylabris variabilis (Coleoptera: Meloidae): a comparative 
      transcriptomics approach.
PG  - 808
LID - 10.1186/s12864-021-08118-8 [doi]
LID - 808
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meloidae (blister beetles) are known to synthetize cantharidin (CA), a 
      toxic and defensive terpene mainly stored in male accessory glands (MAG) and emitted 
      outward through reflex-bleeding. Recent progresses in understanding CA biosynthesis 
      and production organ(s) in Meloidae have been made, but the way in which 
      self-protection is achieved from the hazardous accumulation and release of CA in 
      blister beetles has been experimentally neglected. To provide hints on this pending 
      question, a comparative de novo assembly transcriptomic approach was performed by 
      targeting two tissues where CA is largely accumulated and regularly circulates in 
      Meloidae: the male reproductive tract (MRT) and the haemolymph. Differential gene 
      expression profiles in these tissues were examined in two blister beetle species, 
      Lydus trimaculatus (Fabricius, 1775) (tribe Lyttini) and Mylabris variabilis 
      (Pallas, 1781) (tribe Mylabrini). Upregulated transcripts were compared between the 
      two species to identify conserved genes possibly involved in CA detoxification and 
      transport. RESULTS: Based on our results, we hypothesize that, to avoid 
      auto-intoxication, ABC, MFS or other solute transporters might sequester purported 
      glycosylated CA precursors into MAG, and lipocalins could bind CA and mitigate its 
      reactivity when released into the haemolymph during the autohaemorrhaging response. 
      We also found an over-representation in haemolymph of protein-domains related to 
      coagulation and integument repairing mechanisms that likely reflects the need to 
      limit fluid loss during reflex-bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: The de novo assembled 
      transcriptomes of L. trimaculatus and M. variabilis here provided represent valuable 
      genetic resources to further explore the mechanisms employed to cope with toxicity 
      of CA in blister beetle tissues. These, if revealed, might help conceiving safe and 
      effective drug-delivery approaches to enhance the use of CA in medicine.

TI  - Identification of Four ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter Genes in Cnaphalocrocis 
      medinalis and Their Expression in Response to Insecticide Treatment.
LID - 10.1093/jisesa/iex017 [doi]
LID - 44
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to a superfamily of genes 
      involved in the transport of specific molecules across lipid membranes, as well as 
      insecticide resistance, present in all living organisms. In this study, we combined 
      the Cnaphalocrocis medinals transcriptome database with a bioinformatics approach to 
      identify four C. medinals ABCs (CmABCs), including CmABCG1, CmABCG4, CmABCC2 and 
      CmABCC3. Tissue expression analysis showed that these genes had a tissue-specific 
      expression pattern. CmABCG1 had significantly higher expression in the haemolymph 
      and head compared to the other tissues. The expression of CmABCG4, CmABCC2 and 
      CmABCC3 was highest in the midgut, followed by expression in the fat body. The 
      developmental stage expression analysis showed that CmABCG1, CmABCG4, CmABCC2 and 
      CmABCC3 were mainly expressed in adults. The transcription of CmABCG1, CmABCG4 and 
      CmABCC2 was significantly induced by chlorpyrifos. Taken together, the results of 
      our study provided useful information for understanding of the detoxification system 
      of C. medinalis.

TI  - VraH Is the Third Component of the Staphylococcus aureus VraDEH System Involved in 
      Gallidermin and Daptomycin Resistance and Pathogenicity.
PG  - 2391-401
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02865-15 [doi]
AB  - In bacteria, extracellular signals are transduced into the cell predominantly by 
      two-component systems (TCSs) comprising a regulatory unit triggered by a specific 
      signal. Some of the TCSs control executing units such as ABC transporters involved 
      in antibiotic resistance. For instance, inStaphylococcus aureus, activation of BraSR 
      leads to the upregulation ofvraDEexpression that encodes an ABC transporter playing 
      a role in bacitracin and nisin resistance. In this study, we show that the small 
      staphylococcal transmembrane protein VraH forms, together with VraDE, a 
      three-component system. Although the expression ofvraHin the absence ofvraDEwas 
      sufficient to mediate low-level resistance, only this VraDEH entity conferred 
      high-level resistance against daptomycin and gallidermin. In most staphylococcal 
      genomes,vraHis located immediately downstream ofvraDE, forming an operon, whereas in 
      some species it is localized differently. In an invertebrate infection model, VraDEH 
      significantly enhancedS. aureuspathogenicity. In analogy to the TCS connectors, VraH 
      can be regarded as an ABC connector that modulates the activity of ABC transporters 
      involved in antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Grey mould is caused by the ascomycetes Botrytis cinerea in a range of crop hosts. 
      As a biological control agent, the nucleoside antibiotic wuyiencin has been 
      industrially produced and widely used as an effective fungicide. To elucidate the 
      effects of wuyiencin on the transcriptional regulation in B. cinerea, we, for the 
      first time, report a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of B. cinerea treated with 
      wuyiencin. 2067 genes were differentially expressed, of them, 886 and 1181 genes 
      were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional 
      categorization indicated that transcript levels of genes involved in amino acid 
      metabolism and those encoding putative secreted proteins were altered in response to 
      wuyiencin treatment. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis 
      and energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) and of those encoding ATP-binding 
      cassette transporters was markedly upregulated, whereas that of genes participating 
      in DNA replication, cell cycle, and stress response was downregulated. Furthermore, 
      wuyiencin resulted in mycelial malformation and negatively influenced cell growth 
      rate and conidial yield in B. cinerea. Our results suggest that this nucleoside 
      antibiotic regulates all aspects of cell growth and differentiation in B. cinerea. 
      To summarize, some new candidate pathways and target genes that may related to the 
      protective and antagonistic mechanisms in B. cinerea were identified underlying the 
      action of biological control agents.

TI  - The ABCs of eye color in Tribolium castaneum: orthologs of the Drosophila white, 
      scarlet, and brown Genes.
PG  - 749-59
LID - 10.1534/genetics.114.173971 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, each of the three paralogous ABC transporters, White, 
      Scarlet and Brown, is required for normal pigmentation of the compound eye. We have 
      cloned the three orthologous genes from the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Conceptual 
      translations of Tribolium white (Tcw), scarlet (Tcst), and brown (Tcbw) are 51, 48, 
      and 32% identical to their respective Drosophila counterparts. We have identified 
      loss-of-eye-pigment strains that bear mutations in Tcw and Tcst: the Tcw gene in the 
      ivory (i) strain carries a single-base transversion, which leads to an E → D 
      amino-acid substitution in the highly conserved Walker B motif, while the Tcst gene 
      in the pearl (p) strain has a deletion resulting in incorporation of a premature 
      stop codon. In light of these findings, the mutant strains i and p are herein 
      renamed white(ivory) (w(i)) and scarlet(pearl) (st(p)), respectively. In addition, 
      RNA inhibition of Tcw and Tcst recapitulates the mutant phenotypes, confirming the 
      roles of these genes in normal eye pigmentation, while RNA interference of Tcbw 
      provides further evidence that it has no role in eye pigmentation in Tribolium. We 
      also consider the evolutionary implications of our findings.

TI  - Halogenation-Guided Chemical Screening Provides Insight into Tjipanazole 
      Biosynthesis by the Cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua.

AB  - Halogenated natural products (HNPs) show a wide range of interesting biological 
      activities. Chemistry-guided screening with a software tool dedicated to identifying 
      halogenated compounds in HPLC-MS data indicated the presence of several 
      uncharacterised HNPs in an extract of the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua (Näg.) 
      Gomont 108b. Three new natural products, tjipanazoles K, L, and M, were isolated 
      from this strain together with the known tjipanazoles D and I. Taking into account 
      the structures of all tjipanazole derivatives detected in this strain, reanalysis of 
      the tjipanazole biosynthetic gene cluster allowed us to propose a biosynthetic 
      pathway for the tjipanazoles. As the isolated tjipanazoles show structural 
      similarity to arcyriaflavin A, an inhibitor of the clinically relevant 
      multidrug-transporter ABCG2 overexpressed by different cancer cell lines, the 
      isolated compounds were tested for ABCG2 inhibitory activity. Only tjipanazole K 
      showed appreciable transporter inhibition, whereas the compounds lacking the 
      pyrrolo[3,4-c] ring or featuring additional chloro substituents were found to be 
      much less active.

TI  - An invertebrate model for CNS drug discovery: Transcriptomic and functional analysis 
      of a mammalian P-glycoprotein ortholog.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ABC efflux transporters at the blood brain barrier (BBB), namely the 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp), restrain the development of central nervous system (CNS) 
      drugs. Consequently, early screening of CNS drug candidates is pivotal to identify 
      those affected by efflux activity. Therefore, simple, high-throughput and predictive 
      screening models are required. The grasshopper (locust) has been developed as an 
      invertebrate in situ model for BBB permeability assessment, as it has shown 
      similarities to vertebrate models. METHODS: Transcriptome profiling of ABC efflux 
      transporters in the locust brain was performed. Subsequently, identified transcripts 
      were matched with their counterparts in human, rat, mouse and Drosophila 
      melanogaster, based on amino acid sequence similarity, and phylogenetic trees were 
      constructed to reveal the most likely evolutionary history of the proteins. Further, 
      functional characterization of a P-gp ortholog was achieved through transport 
      studies, using a selective P-gp substrate and locust brain in situ, followed by 
      kinetic analyses. RESULTS: A protein with high sequence similarity to the ABCB1 gene 
      of vertebrates was found in the locust brain, which encodes P-gp in human and is 
      considered the most vital efflux pump. Functionally, this model showed transport 
      kinetic behaviors comparable to those obtained from in vitro models. Particularly, 
      substrate affinity of the putative P-gp was observed as in P-gp expressing cells 
      lines, used for predicting drug penetration across biological barriers. CONCLUSION: 
      Findings suggest a conserved mechanism of brain efflux activity between insects and 
      vertebrates, confirming that this model holds promise for inexpensive and 
      high-throughput screening relative to in vivo models, for CNS drug discovery.

AB  - Evolution of pest resistance reduces the efficacy of insecticidal proteins from the 
      gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) used widely in sprays and 
      transgenic crops. Better understanding of the genetic basis of resistance is needed 
      to more effectively monitor, manage, and counter pest resistance to Bt toxins. Here 
      we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to clarify the genetics of Bt resistance and the 
      associated effects on susceptibility to other microbial insecticides in one of the 
      world's most damaging pests, the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera). We 
      discovered that CRISPR-mediated knockouts of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
      genes HaABCC2 and HaABCC3 together caused >15,000-fold resistance to Bt toxin 
      Cry1Ac, whereas knocking out either HaABCC2 or HaABCC3 alone had little or no 
      effect. Inheritance of resistance was autosomal and recessive. Bioassays of progeny 
      from interstrain crosses revealed that one wild type allele of either HaABCC2 or 
      HaABCC3 is sufficient to sustain substantial susceptibility to Cry1Ac. In contrast 
      with previous results, susceptibility to two insecticides derived from bacteria 
      other than Bt (abamectin and spinetoram), was not affected by knocking out HaABCC2, 
      HaABCC3, or both. The results here provide the first evidence that either HaABCC2 or 
      HaABCC3 protein is sufficient to confer substantial susceptibility to Cry1Ac. The 
      functional redundancy of these two proteins in toxicity of Cry1Ac to H. armigera is 
      expected to reduce the likelihood of field-evolved resistance relative to disruption 
      of a toxic process where mutations affecting a single protein can confer resistance.

AB  - Developmental growth requires coordination between the growth rates of individual 
      tissues and organs. Here, we examine how Drosophila neuromuscular synapses grow to 
      match the size of their target muscles. We show that changes in muscle growth driven 
      by autonomous modulation of insulin receptor signaling produce corresponding changes 
      in synapse size, with each muscle affecting only its presynaptic motor neuron 
      branches. This scaling growth is mechanistically distinct from synaptic plasticity 
      driven by neuronal activity and requires increased postsynaptic differentiation 
      induced by insulin receptor signaling in muscle. We identify the guanine-nucleotide 
      exchange factor dPix as an effector of insulin receptor signaling. Alternatively 
      spliced dPix isoforms that contain a specific exon are necessary and sufficient for 
      postsynaptic differentiation and scaling growth, and their mRNA levels are regulated 
      by insulin receptor signaling. These findings define a mechanism by which the same 
      signaling pathway promotes both autonomous muscle growth and non-autonomous synapse 
      growth.

      developed which offers to be a promising alternative. The silk scaffolds provide 
      sufficient rigidity for easy handling, the scaffolds support the sprouting, 
      migration, attachment and growth of epithelial cells and keratocytes from rat 
      corneal explants; the cells form a cell sheet, preserve their phenotypes, express 
      cytokeratin3 and vimentin respectively. The films also support growth of limbal stem 
      cell evidenced by expression of ABCG2. The cell growth on the silk film and the 
      amniotic membrane is comparable. The implanted film within the rabbit cornea remains 
      transparent, stable. The clinical examination as well as histology shows absence of 
      any inflammatory response or neovascularization. The corneal surface integrity is 
      maintained; tear formation, intraocular pressure and electroretinography of 
      implanted eyes show no adverse changes. The silk fibroin film from non-mulberry silk 
      worms may be a worthy candidate for use as a corneal scaffold.

TI  - Molecular cloning and expression profile of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporter gene from the hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens.
PG  - 2654-64
LID - 10.4238/2015.March.30.26 [doi]
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to a large superfamily of 
      proteins that have important physiological functions in all living organisms. In 
      insects, ABC transporters have important functions in the transport of molecules, 
      and are also involved in insecticide resistance, metabolism, and development. In 
      this study, the Nilaparvata lugens Stal (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) ABCG (NlABCG) gene 
      was identified and characterized. The complete mRNA sequence of NlABCG was 2608-bp 
      long, with an open reading frame of 2064 bp encoding a protein comprised of 687 
      amino acids. The conserved regions include three N-glycosylation and 34 
      phosphorylation sites, as well as seven transmembrane domains. The amino acid 
      identity with the closely related species Acyrthosiphon pisum was 42.8%. 
      Developmental expression analysis using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase 
      PCR suggested that the NlABCG transcript was expressed at all developmental stages 
      of N. lugens. The lowest expression of NlABCG was in the 1st instar, and levels 
      increased with larval growth. The transcript profiles of NlABCG were analyzed in 
      various tissues from a 5th instar nymph, and the highest expression was observed in 
      the midgut. These results suggest that the sequence, characteristics, and expression 
      of NlABCG are highly conserved, and basic information is provided for its functional 
      analysis.

TI  - Leishmania LABCG2 transporter is involved in ATP-dependent transport of thiols.
PG  - 87-97
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20170685 [doi]
AB  - The Leishmania LABCG2 transporter has a key role in the redox metabolism of these 
      protozoan parasites. Recently, the involvement of LABCG2 in virulence, autophagy and 
      oxidative stress has been described. Null mutant parasites for LABCG2 present an 
      increase in the intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH) and trypanothione 
      [T(SH)(2)]. On the other hand, parasites overexpressing LABCG2 transporter export 
      non-protein thiols to the extracellular medium. To explore if LABCG2 may mediate an 
      active transport of non-protein thiols, the effect of these molecules on ATPase 
      activity of LABCG2 as well as the ability of LABCG2 to transport them was determined 
      using a baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system. Our results indicate that all thiols 
      tested [GSH, T(SH)(2)] as well as their oxidized forms GSSG and TS(2) (trypanothione 
      disulfide) stimulate LABCG2-ATPase basal activity. We have measured the transport of 
      [(3)H]-GSH in inside-out Sf9 cell membrane vesicles expressing LABCG2-GFP (green 
      fluorescence protein), finding that LABCG2 was able to mediate a rapid and 
      concentration-dependent uptake of [(3)H]-GSH in the presence of ATP. Finally, we 
      have analyzed the ability of different thiol species to compete for this uptake, 
      T(SH)(2) and TS(2) being the best competitors. The IC(50) value for [(3)H]-GSH 
      uptake in the presence of increasing concentrations of T(SH)(2) was less than 
      100 μM, highlighting the affinity of this thiol for LABCG2. These results provide 
      the first direct evidence that LABCG2 is an ABC transporter of reduced and oxidized 
      non-protein thiols in Leishmania, suggesting that this transporter can play a role 
      in the redox metabolism and related processes in this protozoan parasite.

TI  - ABC transporter mutations in Cry1F-resistant fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) 
      do not result in altered susceptibility to selected small molecule pesticides.
PG  - 949-955
LID - 10.1002/ps.6106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transgenic crops producing Cry and Vip3 insecticidal proteins from the 
      bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis provide effective control of the fall armyworm, 
      Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith. However, cases of practical S. frugiperda 
      resistance to transgenic corn producing Cry1F, Cry1Ab and Cry1A.105 proteins have 
      been reported in the Western hemisphere. Importantly, S. frugiperda resistance to 
      Cry1F corn in Puerto Rico was previously associated with lower susceptibility to 
      synthetic pesticides. When characterized, resistance to transgenic corn in S. 
      frugiperda involved alterations in an ABC transporter subfamily C2 (SfABCC2) gene. 
      The main goal of this work was to test the role of mutations in SfABCC2 that result 
      in resistance to Cry1F in susceptibility to synthetic and semisynthetic small 
      molecule pesticides. RESULTS: Marginal but significantly reduced susceptibility to 
      bifenthrin and increased susceptibility to spinetoram was detected in a 
      Cry1F-resitant S. frugiperda strain from Puerto Rico carrying a frameshift mutation 
      in the SfABCC2 gene. Gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 created a SfABCC2 knockout in a 
      laboratory reference S. frugiperda strain. When compared to the parental reference, 
      the knockout strain displayed 25-fold resistance to Cry1F but no alteration in 
      susceptibility to small molecule pesticides. CONCLUSION: These results support that 
      resistance to Cry1F due to mutations in the SfABCC2 gene do not affect 
      susceptibility to the tested small molecule pesticides.

TI  - Cytochrome P450/ABC transporter inhibition simultaneously enhances ivermectin 
      pharmacokinetics in the mammal host and pharmacodynamics in Anopheles gambiae.
PG  - 8535
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-08906-x [doi]
LID - 8535
AB  - Mass administration of endectocides, drugs that kill blood-feeding arthropods, has 
      been proposed as a complementary strategy to reduce malaria transmission. Ivermectin 
      is one of the leading candidates given its excellent safety profile. Here we provide 
      proof that the effect of ivermectin can be boosted at two different levels by drugs 
      inhibiting the cytochrome or ABC transporter in the mammal host and the target 
      mosquitoes. Using a mini-pig model, we show that drug-mediated cytochrome P450/ABC 
      transporter inhibition results in a 3-fold increase in the time ivermectin remains 
      above mosquito-killing concentrations. In contrast, P450/ABC transporter induction 
      with rifampicin markedly impaired ivermectin absorption. The same 
      ketoconazole-mediated cytochrome/ABC transporter inhibition also occurs outside the 
      mammal host and enhances the mortality of Anopheles gambiae. This was proven by 
      using the samples from the mini-pig experiments to conduct an ex-vivo synergistic 
      bioassay by membrane-feeding Anopheles mosquitoes. Inhibiting the same 
      cytochrome/xenobiotic pump complex in two different organisms to simultaneously 
      boost the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of a drug is a novel concept 
      that could be applied to other systems. Although the lack of a dose-response effect 
      in the synergistic bioassay warrants further exploration, our study may have broad 
      implications for the control of parasitic and vector-borne diseases.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms of insect resistance to Cry toxins generated from the 
      bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) urgently need to be elucidated to enable the 
      improvement and sustainability of Bt-based products. Although downregulation of the 
      expression of midgut receptor genes is a pivotal mechanism of insect resistance to 
      Bt Cry toxins, the underlying transcriptional regulation of these genes remains 
      elusive. Herein, we unraveled the regulatory mechanism of the downregulation of the 
      ABC transporter gene PxABCG1 (also called Pxwhite), a functional midgut receptor of 
      the Bt Cry1Ac toxin in Plutella xylostella. The PxABCG1 promoters of 
      Cry1Ac-susceptible and Cry1Ac-resistant strains were cloned and analyzed, and they 
      showed clear differences in activity. Subsequently, a dual-luciferase reporter 
      assay, a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay, and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments 
      demonstrated that a cis-mutation in a binding site of the Hox transcription factor 
      Antennapedia (Antp) decreased the promoter activity of the resistant strain and 
      eliminated the binding and regulation of Antp, thereby enhancing the resistance of 
      P. xylostella to the Cry1Ac toxin. These results advance our knowledge of the roles 
      of cis- and trans-regulatory variations in the regulation of midgut Cry receptor 
      genes and the evolution of Bt resistance, contributing to a more complete 
      understanding of the Bt resistance mechanism.

AB  - The ABCC2 protein of Plutella xylostella is an important target of Cry1A toxins from 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), but whether this protein is involved in the resistance 
      of P. xylostella to other insecticides remains unclear. In this study, the abcc2 
      gene of P. xylostella was cloned and the expression levels of Pxabcc2 in susceptible 
      and resistant strains were investigated. ABCC2 was found to be expressed 
      3.2-6.7-fold higher in the resistant strain than in the susceptible strain; in the 
      surviving P. xylostella, ABCC2 levels were significantly higher when treated with 
      indoxacarb, avermectin, and beta-cypermethrin. We constructed a stable 
      ABCC2-expressing HEK-293 cell line to reveal the contribution of ABCC2 to 
      insecticide resistance. The avermectin and chlorfenapyr sensitivities of the 
      stably-transfected cell line were significantly lower than those of the control 
      cells. The intracellular avermectin concentration was significantly lower in the 
      stably-transfected cell line than in the control cells after four hours of exposure. 
      This study shows that up-regulated ABCC2 expression is related to insecticide 
      resistance in P. xylostella. Moreover, we used RNA interference technology to reduce 
      ABCC2 levels in P. xylostella. Down-regulating ABCC2 expression did not 
      significantly affect avermectin or chlorfenapyr resistance in P. xylostella. We 
      speculate that increased ABCC2 expression can enhance metabolic resistance in P. 
      xylostella. This study also provides new insights into cross-resistance between B. 
      thuringiensis toxins and chemical insecticides.

AB  - Adoption of biotech crops engineered to express insecticidal toxins from Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) has revolutionized insect pest control in agriculture. For 
      continuing effective application and development of the environmentally friendly Bt 
      biotechnology, it is fundamental to understand pathways of toxicity of Bt toxins in 
      insects. In this study, mutations were introduced in the midgut cadherin gene in the 
      cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. T. ni strains with 
      mutations in the genes of two major receptors for Bt toxins, the midgut cadherin and 
      ABCC2, and three Cry1A toxins with shared and differential midgut binding sites were 
      used as an experimental system to dissect the roles of the cadherin and ABCC2 in the 
      pathways of toxicity of Bt toxins. Results from assays of responses of the T. ni 
      strains to different Bt toxins revealed that the cadherin and ABCC2 play independent 
      roles in the mode of action of Cry1A toxins and that Bt toxins exert insecticidal 
      activity through multiple redundant pathways of toxicity in insects. Besides the 
      cadherin and ABCC2 pathways, there exists an additional major pathway of toxicity to 
      be identified for Cry1Aa. The results also confirmed that the toxicity of Cry2Ab 
      involves neither the cadherin nor the ABCC2 protein. The multiple pathway model for 
      Bt toxins clarified from this study provided new insights into the molecular modes 
      of action of Bt toxins and mechanisms of insect resistance to Bt toxins.

AB  - ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) are energy sensors on the plasma membrane. 
      By sensing the intracellular ADP/ATP ratio of β-cells, pancreatic K(ATP) channels 
      control insulin release and regulate metabolism at the whole body level. They are 
      implicated in many metabolic disorders and diseases and are therefore important drug 
      targets. Here, we present three structures of pancreatic K(ATP) channels solved by 
      cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), at resolutions ranging from 4.1 to 4.5 Å. These 
      structures depict the binding site of the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide, indicate 
      how Kir6.2 (inward-rectifying potassium channel 6.2) N-terminus participates in the 
      coupling between the peripheral SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1) subunit and the 
      central Kir6.2 channel, reveal the binding mode of activating nucleotides, and 
      suggest the mechanism of how Mg-ADP binding on nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) 
      drives a conformational change of the SUR1 subunit.

AB  - In invertebrates, a heterodimer of xenobiotic transcription factors, cap n collar C 
      isoform (CncC) and muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (Maf) mediate cellular defense. 
      In insects, these proteins regulate expression of genes involved in insecticide 
      detoxification. In the current study, we performed sequencing of cDNA copied from 
      RNA isolated from Tribolium castaneum pyrethroid resistant strain (QTC279) beetles 
      injected with CncC or green fluorescence protein (GFP, control) dsRNA. Differential 
      expression analysis of sequences identified 662 genes that showed a decrease and 91 
      genes that showed an increase in expression (p value ≤ 0.01 and log2 fold change of 
      ≥ 1.5) in CncC knockdown insects when compared to their expression in control 
      insects. We selected a subset of 27 downregulated genes and verified their 
      differential expression using qRT-PCR. This subset of 27 genes included 21 genes 
      with a predicted function in xenobiotic detoxification. RNAi and insecticide 
      bioassays were employed to study the function of six of these genes coding for 
      CYP4G7, CYP4G14, GST-1 and four ABC transporters, ABCA-UB, ABCA-A1 and ABCA-A1L and 
      ABCA-9B involved in all three phases of insecticide detoxification. These data 
      suggest that CncC regulates genes coding for proteins involved in detoxification of 
      insecticides.

TI  - Interactions of Alectinib with Human ATP-Binding Cassette Drug Efflux Transporters 
      and Cytochrome P450 Biotransformation Enzymes: Effect on Pharmacokinetic Multidrug 
      Resistance.
PG  - 699-709
LID - 10.1124/dmd.119.086975 [doi]
AB  - Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used as a first-line treatment of 
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In 
      the present work, we investigated possible interactions of this novel drug with 
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters and cytochrome P450 (P450) 
      biotransformation enzymes that play significant roles in the phenomenon of multidrug 
      resistance (MDR) of cancer cells as well as in pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
      interactions. Using accumulation studies in Madin-Darby canine kidney subtype 2 
      (MDCKII) cells alectinib was identified as an inhibitor of ABCB1 and ABCG2 but not 
      of ABCC1. In subsequent drug combination studies, we demonstrated the ability for 
      alectinib to effectively overcome MDR in ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing MDCKII and 
      A431 cells. To describe the pharmacokinetic interaction profile of alectinib in a 
      complete fashion, its possible inhibitory properties toward clinically relevant P450 
      enzymes (i.e., CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5) 
      were evaluated using human P450-expressing insect microsomes, revealing alectinib as 
      a poor interactor. Advantageously for its use in pharmacotherapy, alectinib further 
      exhibited negligible potential to cause any changes in expression of ABCB1, ABCG2, 
      ABCC1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 in intestine, liver, and NSCLC models. Our in 
      vitro observations might serve as a valuable foundation for future in vivo studies 
      that could support the rationale for our conclusions and possibly enable providing 
      more efficient and safer therapy to many oncological patients.

AB  - The emergence of drug-resistant influenza type A viruses (IAVs) necessitates the 
      development of novel anti-IAV agents. Here, we target the IAV hemagglutinin (HA) 
      protein using multivalent peptide library screens and identify PVF-tet, a 
      peptide-based HA inhibitor. PVF-tet inhibits IAV cytopathicity and propagation in 
      cells by binding to newly synthesized HA, rather than to the HA of the parental 
      virus, thus inducing the accumulation of HA within a unique structure, the inducible 
      amphisome, whose production from the autophagosome is accelerated by PVF-tet. The 
      amphisome is also produced in response to IAV infection in the absence of PVF-tet by 
      cells overexpressing ABC transporter subfamily A3, which plays an essential role in 
      the maturation of multivesicular endosomes into the lamellar body, a lipid-sorting 
      organelle. Our results show that the inducible amphisomes can function as a type of 
      organelle-based anti-viral machinery by sequestering HA. PVF-tet efficiently rescues 
      mice from the lethality of IAV infection.

TI  - Genetic Knockouts Indicate That the ABCC2 Protein in the Bollworm Helicoverpa zea Is 
      Not a Major Receptor for the Cry1Ac Insecticidal Protein.
LID - 10.3390/genes12101522 [doi]
LID - 1522
AB  - Members of the insect ATP binding cassette transporter subfamily C2 (ABCC2) in 
      several moth species are known as receptors for the Cry1Ac insecticidal protein from 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Mutations that abolish the functional domains of ABCC2 
      are known to cause resistance to Cry1Ac, although the reported levels of resistance 
      vary widely depending on insect species. In this study, the function of the ABCC2 
      gene as a putative Cry1Ac receptor in Helicoverpa zea, a major pest of over 300 
      crops, was evaluated using CRISPR/Cas9 to progressively eliminate different 
      functional ABCC2 domains. Results from bioassays with edited insect lines support 
      that mutations in ABCC2 were associated with Cry1Ac resistance ratios (RR) ranging 
      from 7.3- to 39.8-fold. No significant differences in susceptibility to Cry1Ac were 
      detected between H. zea with partial or complete ABCC2 knockout, although the 
      highest levels of tolerance were observed when knocking out half of ABCC2. Based on 
      >500-1000-fold RRs reported in similar studies for closely related moth species, the 
      low RRs observed in H. zea knockouts support that ABCC2 is not a major Cry1Ac 
      receptor in this insect.

TI  - Resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin requires mutations in two Plutella 
      xylostella ATP-binding cassette transporter paralogs.

AB  - The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is a cosmopolitan pest and the first 
      species to develop field resistance to toxins from the gram-positive bacterium 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Although previous work has suggested that mutations of 
      ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C2 (ABCC2) or C3 (ABCC3) genes can confer 
      Cry1Ac resistance, here we reveal that P. xylostella requires combined mutations in 
      both PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 to achieve high-level Cry1Ac resistance, rather than simply 
      a mutation of either gene. We identified natural mutations of PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 
      that concurrently occurred in a Cry1Ac-resistant strain (Cry1S1000) of P. 
      xylostella, with a mutation (RA2) causing the mis-splicing of PxABCC2 and another 
      mutation (RA3) leading to the premature termination of PxABCC3. Genetic linkage 
      analysis showed that RA2 and RA3 were tightly linked to Cry1Ac resistance. 
      Introgression of RA2 and RA3 enabled a susceptible strain (G88) of P. xylostella to 
      obtain high resistance to Cry1Ac, confirming that these genes confer resistance. To 
      further support the role of PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 in Cry1Ac resistance, frameshift 
      mutations were introduced into PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 singly and in combination in the 
      G88 strain with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis. Bioassays of CRISPR-based mutant 
      strains, plus genetic complementation tests, demonstrated that the deletion of 
      PxABCC2 or PxABCC3 alone provided < 4-fold tolerance to Cry1Ac, while disruption of 
      both genes together conferred >8,000-fold resistance to Cry1Ac, suggesting the 
      redundant/complementary roles of PxABCC2 and PxABCC3. This work advances our 
      understanding of Bt resistance in P. xylostella by demonstrating mutations within 
      both PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes are required for high-level Cry1Ac resistance.

TI  - Reversing the direction of drug transport mediated by the human multidrug 
      transporter P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 29609-29617
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2016270117 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp), also known as ABCB1, is a cell membrane transporter that 
      mediates the efflux of chemically dissimilar amphipathic drugs and confers 
      resistance to chemotherapy in most cancers. Homologous transmembrane helices (TMHs) 
      6 and 12 of human P-gp connect the transmembrane domains with its nucleotide-binding 
      domains, and several residues in these TMHs contribute to the drug-binding pocket. 
      To investigate the role of these helices in the transport function of P-gp, we 
      substituted a group of 14 conserved residues (seven in both TMHs 6 and 12) with 
      alanine and generated a mutant termed 14A. Although the 14A mutant lost the ability 
      to pump most of the substrates tested out of cancer cells, surprisingly, it acquired 
      a new function. It was able to import four substrates, including rhodamine 123 
      (Rh123) and the taxol derivative flutax-1. Similar to the efflux function of 
      wild-type P-gp, we found that uptake by the 14A mutant is ATP hydrolysis-, substrate 
      concentration-, and time-dependent. Consistent with the uptake function, the mutant 
      P-gp also hypersensitizes HeLa cells to Rh123 by 2- to 2.5-fold. Further mutagenesis 
      identified residues from both TMHs 6 and 12 that synergistically form a switch in 
      the central region of the two helices that governs whether a given substrate is 
      pumped out of or into the cell. Transforming P-gp or an ABC drug exporter from an 
      efflux transporter into a drug uptake pump would constitute a paradigm shift in 
      efforts to overcome cancer drug resistance.

TI  - Insecticidal Activity of Melaleuca alternifolia Essential Oil and RNA-Seq Analysis 
      of Sitophilus zeamais Transcriptome in Response to Oil Fumigation.
PG  - e0167748
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0167748 [doi]
LID - e0167748
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cereal weevil, Sitophilus zeamais is one of the most destructive 
      pests of stored cereals worldwide. Frequent use of fumigants for managing 
      stored-product insects has led to the development of resistance in insects. 
      Essential oils from aromatic plants including the tea oil plant, Melaleuca 
      alternifolia may provide environmentally friendly alternatives to currently used 
      pest control agents. However, little is known about molecular events involved in 
      stored-product insects in response to plant essential oil fumigation. RESULTS: M. 
      alternifolia essential oil was shown to possess the fumigant toxicity against S. 
      zeamais. The constituent, terpinen-4-ol was the most effective compound for fumigant 
      toxicity. M. alternifolia essential oil significantly inhibited the activity of 
      three enzymes in S. zeamais, including two detoxifying enzymes, glutathione 
      S-transferase (GST), and carboxylesterase (CarE), as well as a nerve conduction 
      enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Comparative transcriptome analysis of S. 
      zeamais through RNA-Seq identified a total of 3,562 differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs), of which 2,836 and 726 were up-regulated and down-regulated in response to 
      M. alternifolia essential oil fumigation, respectively. Based on gene ontology (GO) 
      analysis, the majority of DEGs were involved in insecticide detoxification and 
      mitochondrial function. Furthermore, an abundance of DEGs mapped into the metabolism 
      pathway in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database were 
      associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, including cytochrome 
      P450s, CarEs, GSTs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters). Some 
      DEGs mapped into the proteasome and phagosome pathway were found to be significantly 
      enriched. These results led us to propose a model of insecticide action that M. 
      alternifolia essential oil likely directly affects the hydrogen carrier to block the 
      electron flow and interfere energy synthesis in mitochondrial respiratory chain. 
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study to perform a comparative transcriptome analysis 
      of S. zeamais in response to M. alternifolia essential oil fumigation. Our results 
      provide new insights into the insecticidal mechanism of M. alternifolia essential 
      oil fumigation against S. zeamais and eventually contribute to the management of 
      this important agricultural pest.

TI  - Transcriptome Profiling Revealed Potentially Critical Roles for Digestion and 
      Defense-Related Genes in Insects' Use of Resistant Host Plants: A Case Study with 
      Sitobion Avenae.
LID - 10.3390/insects11020090 [doi]
LID - 90
AB  - Using host plant resistance (HPR) in management of insect pests is often 
      environmentally friendly and suitable for sustainable development of agricultural 
      industries. However, this strategy can be limited by rapid evolution of insect 
      populations that overcome HPR, for which the underlying molecular factors and 
      mechanisms are not well understood. To address this issue, we analyzed 
      transcriptomes of two distinct biotypes of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae 
      (Fabricius), on wheat and barley. This analysis revealed a large number of 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between biotypes 1 and 3 on wheat and barley. 
      The majority of them were common DEGs occurring on both wheat and barley. GO and 
      KEGG enrichment analyses for these common DEGs demonstrated significant expression 
      divergence between both biotypes in genes associated with digestion and defense. Top 
      defense-related common DEGs with the most significant expression changes included 
      three peroxidases, two UGTs (UDP-glycosyltransferase), two cuticle proteins, one 
      glutathione S-transferases (GST), one superoxide dismutase, and one esterase, 
      suggesting their potentially critical roles in the divergence of S. avenae biotypes. 
      A relatively high number of specific DEGs on wheat were identified for peroxidases 
      (9) and P450s (8), indicating that phenolic compounds and hydroxamic acids may play 
      key roles in resistance of wheat against S. avenae. Enrichment of specific DEGs on 
      barley for P450s and ABC transporters suggested their key roles in this aphid's 
      detoxification against secondary metabolites (e.g., alkaloids) in barley. Our 
      results can provide insights into the molecular factors and functions that explain 
      biotype adaptation in insects and their use of resistant plants. This study also has 
      significant implications for developing new resistant cultivars, developing 
      strategies that limit rapid development of insect biotypes, and extending resistant 
      crop cultivars' durability and sustainability in integrated management programs.

TI  - The stromal genome heterogeneity between breast and prostate tumors revealed by a 
      comparative transcriptomic analysis.
PG  - 8687-97
AB  - Stromal microenvironment increases tumor cell survival, proliferation and migration, 
      and promotes angiogenesis. In order to provide comprehensive information on the 
      stromal heterogeneity of diverse tumors, here we employed the microarray datasets of 
      human invasive breast and prostate cancer-associated stromals and applied Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to compare the gene expression profiles between them. As 
      a result, 8 up-regulated pathways and 73 down-regulated pathways were identified in 
      the breast tumor stroma, while 32 up-regulated pathways and 18 down-regulated 
      pathways were identified in the prostate tumor stroma. Only 9 pathways such as 
      tryptophan metabolism were commonly up or down regulated, but most of them 
      (including ABC transporters) were specific for these two tumors. Several essential 
      tumors stromal marker genes were also significantly identified. For example, CDH3 
      was significantly up-regulated in the stromals of both breast and prostate tumors, 
      however EGFR was only significantly down-regulated in the stromal of breast tumor. 
      Our study would be helpful for future therapeutic and predictive applications in 
      breast and prostate cancers.

TI  - Mutants of the white ABCG Transporter in Drosophila melanogaster Have Deficient 
      Olfactory Learning and Cholesterol Homeostasis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222312967 [doi]
LID - 12967
AB  - Drosophila's white gene encodes an ATP-binding cassette G-subfamily (ABCG) 
      half-transporter. White is closely related to mammalian ABCG family members that 
      function in cholesterol efflux. Mutants of white have several behavioral phenotypes 
      that are independent of visual defects. This study characterizes a novel defect of 
      white mutants in the acquisition of olfactory memory using the aversive olfactory 
      conditioning paradigm. The w(1118) mutants learned slower than wildtype controls, 
      yet with additional training, they reached wildtype levels of performance. The 
      w(1118) learning phenotype is also found in the w(apricot) and w(coral) alleles, is 
      dominant, and is rescued by genomic white and mini-white transgenes. Reducing 
      dietary cholesterol strongly impaired olfactory learning for wildtype controls, 
      while w(1118) mutants were resistant to this deficit. The w(1118) mutants displayed 
      higher levels of cholesterol and cholesterol esters than wildtype under this 
      low-cholesterol diet. Increasing levels of serotonin, dopamine, or both in the white 
      mutants significantly improved w(1118) learning. However, serotonin levels were not 
      lower in the heads of the w(1118) mutants than in wildtype controls. There were also 
      no significant differences found in synapse numbers within the w(1118) brain. We 
      propose that the w(1118) learning defect may be due to inefficient biogenic amine 
      signaling brought about by altered cholesterol homeostasis.

TI  - Impact of Camellia japonica Bee Pollen Polyphenols on Hyperuricemia and Gut 
      Microbiota in Potassium Oxonate-Induced Mice.
LID - 10.3390/nu13082665 [doi]
LID - 2665
AB  - Camellia japonica bee pollen is one of the major types of bee pollen in China and 
      exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aims of our study were to 
      evaluate the effects and the possible mechanism of Camellia japonica bee pollen 
      polyphenols on the treatment of hyperuricemia induced by potassium oxonate (PO). The 
      results showed that Camellia japonica bee pollen ethyl acetate extract (CPE-E) owned 
      abundant phenolic compounds and strong antioxidant capabilities. Administration with 
      CPE-E for two weeks greatly reduced serum uric acid and improved renal function. It 
      inhibited liver xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity and regulated the expression of 
      urate transporter 1 (URAT1), glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), organic anion 
      transporter 1 (OAT1), organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) and ATP-binding cassette 
      superfamily gmember 2 (ABCG2) in kidneys. Moreover, CPE-E suppressed the activation 
      of the toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear factor-κB 
      (TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB) signaling pathway and nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
      domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in 
      PO-treated mice, and related inflammatory cytokines were reduced. CPE-E also 
      modulated gut microbiota structure, showing that the abundance of Lactobacillus and 
      Clostridiaceae increased in hyperuicemic mice. This study was conducted to explore 
      the protective effect of CPE-E on hyperuricemia and provide new thoughts for the 
      exploitation of Camellia japonica bee pollen.

TI  - Genetic mapping of fitness determinants across the malaria parasite Plasmodium 
      falciparum life cycle.
PG  - e1008453
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1008453 [doi]
LID - e1008453
AB  - Determining the genetic basis of fitness is central to understanding evolution and 
      transmission of microbial pathogens. In human malaria parasites (Plasmodium 
      falciparum), most experimental work on fitness has focused on asexual blood stage 
      parasites, because this stage can be easily cultured, although the transmission of 
      malaria requires both female Anopheles mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. We explore a 
      powerful approach to identify the genetic determinants of parasite fitness across 
      both invertebrate and vertebrate life-cycle stages of P. falciparum. This combines 
      experimental genetic crosses using humanized mice, with selective whole genome 
      amplification and pooled sequencing to determine genome-wide allele frequencies and 
      identify genomic regions under selection across multiple lifecycle stages. We 
      applied this approach to genetic crosses between artemisinin resistant (ART-R, 
      kelch13-C580Y) and ART-sensitive (ART-S, kelch13-WT) parasites, recently isolated 
      from Southeast Asian patients. Two striking results emerge: we observed (i) a strong 
      genome-wide skew (>80%) towards alleles from the ART-R parent in the mosquito stage, 
      that dropped to ~50% in the blood stage as selfed ART-R parasites were selected 
      against; and (ii) repeatable allele specific skews in blood stage parasites with 
      particularly strong selection (selection coefficient (s) ≤ 0.18/asexual cycle) 
      against alleles from the ART-R parent at loci on chromosome 12 containing MRP2 and 
      chromosome 14 containing ARPS10. This approach robustly identifies selected loci and 
      has strong potential for identifying parasite genes that interact with the mosquito 
      vector or compensatory loci involved in drug resistance.

AB  - Pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters are a group of membrane proteins 
      belonging to the ABCG sub-family of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. There 
      is clear evidence for the involvement of plant ABC transporters in resistance to 
      fungal and bacterial pathogens, but not in the biotic stress response to insect or 
      herbivore attack. Here, we describe a PDR transporter, ABCG5/PDR5, from Nicotiana 
      tabacum. GFP fusion and subcellular fractionation studies revealed that ABCG5/PDR5 
      is localized to the plasma membrane. Staining of transgenic plants expressing the 
      GUS reporter gene under the control of the ABCG5/PDR5 transcription promoter and 
      immunoblotting of wild-type plants showed that, under standard growth conditions, 
      ABCG5/PDR5 is highly expressed in roots, stems and flowers, but is only expressed at 
      marginal levels in leaves. Interestingly, ABCG5/PDR5 expression is induced in leaves 
      by methyl jasmonate, wounding, pathogen infiltration, or herbivory by Manduca sexta. 
      To address the physiological role of ABCG5/PDR5, N. tabacum plants silenced for the 
      expression of ABCG5/PDR5 were obtained. No phenotypic modification was observed 
      under standard conditions. However, a small increase in susceptibility to the fungus 
      Fusarium oxysporum was observed. A stronger effect was observed in relation to 
      herbivory: silenced plants allowed better growth and faster development of M. sexta 
      larvae than wild-type plants, indicating an involvement of this PDR transporter in 
      resistance to M. sexta herbivory.

TI  - Molecular characterization of Cry1F resistance in fall armyworm, Spodoptera 
      frugiperda from Brazil.

AB  - Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is a major lepidopteran pest of 
      maize in Brazil and its control particularly relies on the use of genetically 
      engineered crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins such as Cry1F. 
      However, control failures compromising the efficacy of this technology have been 
      reported in many regions in Brazil, but the mechanism of Cry1F resistance in 
      Brazilian fall armyworm populations remained elusive. Here we investigated the 
      molecular mechanism of Cry1F resistance in two field-collected strains of S. 
      frugiperda from Brazil exhibiting high levels of Cry1F resistance. We first 
      rigorously evaluated several candidate reference genes for normalization of gene 
      expression data across strains, larval instars and gut tissues, and identified 
      ribosomal proteins L10, L17 and RPS3A to be most suitable. We then investigated the 
      expression pattern of ten potential Bt toxin receptors/enzymes in both neonates and 
      2nd instar gut tissue of Cry1F resistant fall armyworm strains compared to a 
      susceptible strain. Next we sequenced the ATP-dependent Binding Cassette subfamily 
      C2 gene (ABCC2) and identified three mutated sites present in ABCC2 of both Cry1F 
      resistant strains: two of them, a GY deletion (positions 788-789) and a P799 K/R 
      amino acid substitution, located in a conserved region of ABCC2 extracellular loop 4 
      (EC4) and another amino acid substitution, G1088D, but in a less conserved region. 
      We further characterized the role of the novel mutations present in EC4 by 
      functionally expressing both wild type and mutated ABCC2 transporters in insect cell 
      lines, and confirmed a critical role of both sites for Cry1F binding by cell 
      viability assays. Finally, we assessed the frequency of the mutant alleles by pooled 
      population sequencing and pyrosequencing in 40 fall armyworm populations collected 
      from maize fields in different regions in Brazil. We found that the GY deletion 
      being present at high frequency. However we also observed many rare alleles which 
      disrupt residues between sites 783-799, and their diversity and abundance in field 
      collected populations lends further support to the importance of the EC4 domain for 
      Cry1F toxicity.

AB  - ok mutants of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, exhibit highly translucent larval skin 
      resulting from the inability to incorporate uric acid into the epidermal cells. Here 
      we report the identification of a gene responsible for the ok mutation using 
      positional cloning and RNAi experiments. In two independent ok mutant strains, we 
      found a 49-bp deletion and a 233-bp duplication, respectively, in mRNAs of a novel 
      gene, Bm-ok, which encodes a half-type ABC transporter, each of which results in 
      translation of a truncated protein in each mutant. Although the Bm-ok sequence was 
      homologous to well-known transporter genes, white, scarlet, and brown in Drosophila, 
      the discovery of novel orthologs in the genomes of lepidopteran, hymenopteran, and 
      hemipteran insects identifies it as a member of a new distinct subfamily of 
      transporters. Embryonic RNAi of Bm-ok demonstrated that repression of Bm-ok causes a 
      translucent phenotype in the first-instar silkworm larva. We discuss the possibility 
      that Bm-ok forms a heterodimer with another half-type ABC transporter, Bmwh3, and 
      acts as a uric acid transporter in the silkworm epidermis.

TI  - A specialized ABC efflux transporter GcABC-G1 confers monoterpene resistance to 
      Grosmannia clavigera, a bark beetle-associated fungal pathogen of pine trees.
PG  - 886-898
LID - 10.1111/nph.12063 [doi]
AB  - Grosmannia clavigera is a bark beetle-vectored pine pathogen in the mountain pine 
      beetle epidemic in western North America. Grosmannia clavigera colonizes pines 
      despite the trees' massive oleoresin terpenoid defences. We are using a functional 
      genomics approach to identify G. clavigera's mechanisms of adaptation to pine 
      defences. We annotated the ABC transporters in the G. clavigera genome and generated 
      RNA-seq transcriptomes from G. clavigera grown with a range of terpenes. We 
      functionally characterized GcABC-G1, a pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporter 
      that was highly induced by terpenes, using qRT-PCR, gene knock-out and heterologous 
      expression in yeast. Deleting GcABC-G1 increased G. clavigera's sensitivity to 
      monoterpenes and delayed development of symptoms in inoculated young lodgepole pine 
      trees. Heterologous expression of GcABC-G1 in yeast increased tolerance to 
      monoterpenes. G. clavigera but not the deletion mutant, can use (+)-limonene as a 
      carbon source. Phylogenetic analysis placed GcABC-G1 outside the ascomycete PDR 
      transporter clades. G. clavigera appears to have evolved two mechanisms to survive 
      and grow when exposed to monoterpenes: GcABC-G1 controls monoterpene levels within 
      the fungal cells and G. clavigera uses monoterpenes as a carbon source. This work 
      has implications for understanding adaptation to host defences in an important 
      forest insect-fungal system, and potentially for metabolic engineering of terpenoid 
      production in yeast.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are important transmembrane proteins 
      encoded by a supergene family. The majority of ABC proteins are primary active 
      transporters that bind and hydrolyze ATP to mediate the efflux of a diverse range of 
      substrates across lipid membranes. In this study, we cloned and characterized a 
      putative multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) from Rhopalosiphum padi 
      encoded by ABCC1. Structural analysis showed that this protein has structural 
      features typical of the ABC transporter family. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
      the amino acid sequence was highly similar that of the corresponding protein from 
      Acyrthosiphon pisum. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis 
      showed that ABCC1 was expressed throughout all R. padi developmental stages, with 
      the highest level of expression in the fourth larval instar. We also examined ABCC1 
      expression in four different tissue types and found that it was most highly 
      expressed in the midgut. Exposing R. padi to imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos increased 
      ABCC1 expression. Furthermore, ABCC1 expression was higher in the 
      imidacloprid-resistant (IR) and chlorpyrifos-resistant (CR) strains than in an 
      insecticide-susceptible strain (SS) of R. padi. Exposing R. padi to verapamil in 
      combination with insecticides significantly increased the toxicity of the 
      insecticides. The respective synergy factor of CR and IR R. padi strain was 1.33 and 
      1.26, which was lower than that (2.72 and 1.64, respectively) of the SS. Our results 
      clarify the biological function of ABCC1 in R. padi, particularly its role in 
      insecticide resistance, and suggest novel strategies for pest management that use 
      ABC transporter inhibitors to increase the effectiveness of insecticides.

AB  - The pan-neuron-specific knockdown of dABCA, a Drosophila homologue of the human ATP 
      binding cassette subfamily A member 13 gene, increases social space without 
      affecting climbing ability and induces the early onset of evening activity in adult 
      flies followed by relatively high activity throughout the day. Satellite bouton 
      numbers in the presynaptic terminals of motor neurons are increased in dABCA 
      knockdown flies. In the present study, we further characterized pan-neuron-specific 
      dABCA knockdown flies and found that active zones in the presynaptic terminals of 
      motor neurons increased, whereas learning abilities decreased in larvae. Genetic 
      crossing experiments revealed that the hippo mutation enhanced the hyperactivity 
      phenotype of adults, but suppressed the increased satellite bouton phenotype induced 
      by the dABCA knockdown. Drosophila ABCA is predicted to transport lipid molecules 
      and impair the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane, 
      and these local changes are considered to be important for various cellular 
      functions. The disruption of lipid homeostasis in central and peripheral nervous 
      systems by the dABCA knockdown may affect the Hippo-related signaling pathway in 
      order to induce the observed phenotypes.

AB  - Pathogens able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) induce long-term neurological 
      sequelae and death. Understanding how neurotropic pathogens bypass this strong 
      physiological barrier is a prerequisite to devise therapeutic strategies. Here we 
      propose an innovative model of infection in the developing Drosophila brain, 
      combining whole brain explants with in vivo systemic infection. We find that several 
      mammalian pathogens are able to cross the Drosophila BBB, including Group B 
      Streptococcus (GBS). Amongst GBS surface components, lipoproteins, and in particular 
      the B leucine-rich Blr, are important for BBB crossing and virulence in Drosophila. 
      Further, we identify (V)LDL receptor LpR2, expressed in the BBB, as a host receptor 
      for Blr, allowing GBS translocation through endocytosis. Finally, we show that Blr 
      is required for BBB crossing and pathogenicity in a murine model of infection. Our 
      results demonstrate the potential of Drosophila for studying BBB crossing by 
      pathogens and identify a new mechanism by which pathogens exploit the machinery of 
      host barriers to generate brain infection.

TI  - Genome wide association mapping of epi-cuticular wax genes in Sorghum bicolor.
PG  - 1727-1737
LID - 10.1007/s12298-020-00848-5 [doi]
AB  - Sorghum accumulates epi-cuticular wax (EW) in leaves, sheaths, and culms. EW reduces 
      the transpirational and nontranspirational (nonstomatal) water loss and protects the 
      plant from severe drought stress in addition to imparting resistance against insect 
      pests. Results presented here are from the analysis of EW content of 387 diverse 
      sorghum accessions and its genome-wide association study (GWAS). EW content in 
      sorghum leaves ranged from 0.1 to 29.7 mg cm(-2) with a mean value of 5.1 mg cm(-2). 
      GWAS using 265,487 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified thirty-seven putative 
      genes associated (P < 9.89E-06) with EW biosynthesis and transport in sorghum. Major 
      EW biosynthetic genes identified included 3-Oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein (ACP)] 
      synthase III, an Ankyrin repeat protein, a bHLH-MYC, and an R2R3-MYB transcription 
      factor. Genes involved in EW regulation or transport included an ABC transporter, a 
      Lipid exporter ABCA1, a Multidrug resistance protein, Inositol 1, 3, 4-trisphosphate 
      5/6-kinase, and a Cytochrome P450. This GWA study thus demonstrates the potential 
      for genetic manipulation of EW content in sorghum for better adaptation to biotic 
      and abiotic stress.

TI  - Independent and Synergistic Effects of Knocking out Two ABC Transporter Genes on 
      Resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa in Diamondback Moth.

AB  - Insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used widely in sprays and 
      transgenic crops to control insect pests. However, evolution of resistance by pests 
      can reduce the efficacy of Bt toxins. Here we analyzed resistance to Bt toxins 
      Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa in the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), one of the world's 
      most destructive pests of vegetable crops. We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to 
      create strains with knockouts of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes 
      PxABCC2, PxABCC3, or both. Bioassay results show that knocking out either gene alone 
      caused at most 2.9-fold resistance but knocking out both caused >10,320-fold 
      resistance to Cry1Ac and 380-fold resistance to Cry1Fa. Cry1Ac resistance in the 
      double knockout strain was recessive and genetically linked with the PxABCC2/PxABCC3 
      loci. The results provide insight into the mechanism of cross-resistance to Cry1Fa 
      in diamondback moth. They also confirm previous work with this pest showing that 
      mutations disrupting both genes cause higher resistance to Cry1Ac than mutations 
      affecting either PxABCC2 or PxABCC3 alone. Together with previous work, the results 
      here highlight the value of using single and multiple gene knockouts to better 
      understand the independent and synergistic effects of putative Bt toxin receptors on 
      resistance to Bt toxins.

      systems.

AB  - Membrane transporters play a significant role in facilitating transmembrane drug 
      movement. For new pharmacological agents, it is important to evaluate potential 
      interactions (e.g., substrate specificity and/or inhibition) with human transporters 
      that may affect their pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or toxicity. Bilastine is a new 
      nonsedating H₁ antihistamine indicated for the treatment of allergic 
      rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The in vitro inhibitory effects of bilastine were 
      assessed on 12 human transporters: four efflux [multidrug resistance protein 1 
      (MDR1) or P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug 
      resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), and bile salt export pump) and eight uptake 
      transporters (sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic cation 
      transporter (OCT)1, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP2B1, OATP1B1, 
      and OATP1B3). Only mild inhibition was found for MDR1-, OCT1-, and OATP2B1-mediated 
      transport of probe substrates at the highest bilastine concentration assayed (300 
      μM; half-maximal inhibitory concentration: ≥300 μM). Bilastine transport by MDR1, 
      BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 was also investigated in vitro. Only MDR1 active 
      transport of bilastine was relevant, whereas it did not appear to be a substrate of 
      OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3, nor was it transported substantially by BCRP. Drug-drug 
      interactions resulting from bilastine inhibition of drug transporters that would be 
      generally regarded as clinically relevant are unlikely. Additionally, bilastine did 
      not appear to be a substrate of human BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 and thus is not a 
      potential victim of inhibitors of these transporters. On the other hand, based on in 
      vitro evaluation, clinically relevant interactions with MDR1 inhibitors are 
      anticipated.

TI  - Bombyx ortholog of the Drosophila eye color gene brown controls riboflavin transport 
      in Malpighian tubules.

AB  - The Drosophila eye color gene brown is known to control the transport of pteridine 
      precursors in adult eyes. The Brown protein belongs to the ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) transporter G family, which includes proteins encoded by the genes brown, 
      scarlet, and white. These genes are responsible for pigmentation in Drosophila and 
      the domestic silkworm Bombyx mori. Although orthologs of brown are conserved among 
      insects, the function of this gene is only known in Drosophila. Here, we elucidated 
      the function of the B. mori ortholog Bm-brown. We examined the spatial and temporal 
      expression profiles of Bm-brown and found that this gene was specifically and 
      continuously expressed in larval Malpighian tubules (MTs), indicating this gene has 
      a special function in MTs. We then successfully obtained a Bm-brown knockout (KO) 
      strain based on a wild-type (WT) strain using the clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system. We 
      found that larval MTs of the KO strain were white, whereas those of WT were yellow. 
      It is known that larval yellow MTs of WT are due to the accumulation of riboflavin. 
      Therefore, we compared the riboflavin contents of MTs of KO and WT strains, and 
      found that the riboflavin level in the KO strain was 20 fold less than that in WT 
      during the 5th instar period. MTs are known to exhibit a similar milky color in w-3 
      mutant larvae due to a deficiency of riboflavin accumulation. The responsible gene 
      for w-3 mutant is the Bmwh3 gene, which is orthologous to Drosophila white. Thus, we 
      speculate that Bm-brown is heterodimerized with Bmwh3, similar to Brown/White in 
      Drosophila, and acts as a riboflavin transporter in silkworm MTs.

AB  - The Asian corn borer (ACB), Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée), can develop strong 
      resistance to Cry1Ab, the most widely commercialized Cry toxin for Bt maize 
      worldwide. It is essential to understand the mechanism of resistance for management 
      of this species, but information on the post-transcriptional regulation of Bt 
      resistance in this target insect is limited. In the present study, RNA was extracted 
      from the ACB in various larval stages (1-5 instar) from Cry1Ab-sensitive (ACB-BtS) 
      and -resistant (ACB-AbR) strains, each of which included two biological replicates. 
      Using Illumina sequencing, a total of 23,809,890 high-quality reads were collected 
      from the four ACB libraries. The numbers of known microRNAs (miRNAs) were 302 and 
      395 for ACB-BtS and 268 and 287 for ACB-AbR. Using Mireap software, we identified 32 
      and 16 potential novel miRNAs for ACB-BtS and 18 and 22 for ACB-AbR. Among them, 21 
      known and 1 novel miRNAs had significantly different expression between ACB-BtS and 
      ACB-AbR. Several miRNAs were observed to target potential Bt receptor genes, such as 
      aminopeptidase N and cadherin-like protein. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor 
      biosynthetic process and ABC transporters pathway were identified through Gene 
      Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis of target genes of the differentially expressed 
      miRNAs.

AB  - Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) resistance among arthropod species is a 
      model for understanding the molecular adaptations in response to insecticide 
      exposures. Previous studies reported that DDT resistance may involve one or multiple 
      detoxification genes, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione 
      S-transferases (GSTs), esterases, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, or 
      changes in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. However, the possible involvement 
      of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes associated 
      with DDT resistance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R remains poorly 
      understood. In this study, the majority of the resulting miRNAs discovered in small 
      RNA libraries from 91-R and the susceptible control strain, 91-C, ranged from 16-25 
      nt, and contained 163 precursors and 256 mature forms of previously-known miRNAs 
      along with 17 putative novel miRNAs. Quantitative analyses predicted the 
      differential expression of ten miRNAs between 91-R and 91-C, and, based on Gene 
      Ontology and pathway analysis, these ten miRNAs putatively target transcripts 
      encoding proteins involved in detoxification mechanisms. RT-qPCR validated an 
      inverse correlation between levels of differentially-expressed miRNAs and their 
      putatively targeted transcripts, which implies a role of these miRNAs in the 
      differential regulation of detoxification pathways in 91-R compared to 91-C. This 
      study provides evidence associating the differential expression of miRNAs in 
      response to multigenerational DDT selection in Drosophila melanogaster and provides 
      important clues for understanding the possible roles of miRNAs in mediating 
      insecticide resistance traits.

AB  - Short-read high-throughput RNA sequencing, though powerful, is limited in its 
      ability to directly measure exon connectivity in mRNAs that contain multiple 
      alternative exons located farther apart than the maximum read length. Here, we use 
      the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer to identify 7,899 'full-length' isoforms 
      expressed from four Drosophila genes, Dscam1, MRP, Mhc, and Rdl. These results 
      demonstrate that nanopore sequencing can be used to deconvolute individual isoforms 
      and that it has the potential to be a powerful method for comprehensive 
      transcriptome characterization.

TI  - The ABCB Multidrug Resistance Proteins Do Not Contribute to Ivermectin 
      Detoxification in the Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say).
LID - 10.3390/insects11020135 [doi]
LID - 135
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is a significant 
      agricultural pest that has developed resistance to many insecticides that are used 
      to control it. Investigating the mechanisms of insecticide detoxification in this 
      pest is important for ensuring its continued control, since they may be contributors 
      to such resistance. Multidrug resistance (MDR) genes that code for the ABCB 
      transmembrane efflux transporters are one potential source of insecticide 
      detoxification activity that have not been thoroughly examined in L. decemlineata. 
      In this study, we annotated the ABCB genes found in the L. decemlineata genome and 
      then characterized the expression profiles across midgut, nerve, and Malpighian 
      tubule tissues of the three full transporters identified. To investigate if these 
      genes are involved in defense against the macrocyclic lactone insecticide ivermectin 
      in this insect, each gene was silenced using RNA interference or MDR protein 
      activity was inhibited using a chemical inhibitor, verapamil, before challenging the 
      insects with a dose of ivermectin. Survival of the insects did not significantly 
      change due to gene silencing or protein inhibition, suggesting that MDR transporters 
      do not significantly contribute to defense against ivermectin in L. decemlineata.

TI  - Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of d-alanylation of teichoic acids 
      sensitizes pathogenic enterococci to β-lactams.
PG  - 3162-3169
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkz322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococci intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins represent a major 
      cause of healthcare-associated infections, and the emergence of MDR makes 
      therapeutic approaches particularly challenging. OBJECTIVES: Teichoic acids are cell 
      wall glycopolymers present in Gram-positive bacteria. Teichoic acids can be modified 
      by d-alanylation, which requires four proteins encoded by the dltABCD operon. Our 
      objective was to evaluate the Dlt system as a druggable target to treat enterococcal 
      infections. METHODS: The susceptibility of a d-alanylation-deficient strain of 
      Enterococcus faecalis to β-lactam antibiotics individually and/or in combination was 
      analysed. Moreover, a DltA inhibitor was synthesized to test pharmacological 
      inhibition of d-alanylation in vivo and in host using the animal model Galleria 
      mellonella with different clinical isolates of E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. 
      RESULTS: Most cephalosporins used as mono treatment had no impact on survival of the 
      parental strain, but were slightly lethal for the dltA mutant of E. faecalis. 
      Addition of a very low concentration of amoxicillin significantly increased killing 
      of the dltA mutant under these conditions. The most spectacular effect was obtained 
      with a combination of cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and amoxicillin (0.03 mg/L). In the 
      presence of the inhibitor, the WT strain was as susceptible to this combination 
      treatment as the dltA mutant. This molecule associated with the antibiotics was also 
      effective in killing other E. faecalis clinical isolates and successfully prevented 
      death of Galleria infected with either E. faecalis or E. faecium. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      combined results support the potential usefulness of the Dlt system as a target to 
      potentiate antibiotic combination therapies for the treatment of drug-resistant 
      enterococci.

AB  - Field-evolved resistance of insect pests to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins (Cry 
      toxins) is a threat to the efficacy of Bt-based bio-insecticides and transgenic 
      crops. Recent reports have suggested that ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily 
      C2 (ABCC2) and cadherin-like receptor play important roles in conferring 
      susceptibility to Cry1 toxins. However, the receptors involved in Bt susceptibility 
      in each insect remain unclear. To determine the receptors that are involved in the 
      susceptibility of Bombyx mori to Cry1 toxins (1Ab, 1Ac and 1Fa), we conducted diet 
      overlay bioassay using B. mori strains disrupted with one or two receptor (s) among 
      BmABCC2, BmABCC3, and cadherin-like receptor (BtR175) generated by transcription 
      activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene editing. The single-knockout 
      strains for BmABCC2 showed resistance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, whereas only strains 
      with double knockout of BmABCC2 and BmABCC3 exhibited high resistance to Cry1Fa. 
      Progeny populations generated from the crossing of heterozygotes for BtR175 knockout 
      allele included 25% theoretical homozygotes for the BtR175 knockout allele and they 
      showed resistance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac. Then, through a cell swelling assay using 
      Sf9 cells ectopically expressing the receptor, we analyzed the mechanisms underlying 
      the different contributions of BmABCC2, BmABCC3, and BtR175 to larval 
      susceptibility. The receptor activity of BmABCC2 for Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac was far 
      higher than that of BmABCC3, and BtR175 synergistically enhanced the receptor 
      activity of BmABCC2. This result well explained the important involvement of BmABCC2 
      and BtR175 in the larval susceptibility to Cry1A toxins. By contrast, the receptor 
      activities of BmABCC2 and BmABCC3 for Cry1Fa were observed at a similar level and 
      synergistic effect of BtR175 was small. This finding explains the equal importance 
      of BmABCC2 and BmABCC3 and very small contribution of BtR175 on larval 
      susceptibility to Cry1Fa. Thus, we demonstrated the different importance of BmABCC2, 
      BmABCC3, and BtR175 to various Cry1 toxins as susceptibility-determining factors in 
      B. mori larvae and the underlying basis for the observed differences. Furthermore, a 
      weak correlation was indicated between the binding affinity and receptor activities 
      of BmABCC2 and BmABCC3 to Cry1 toxins.

AB  - Evolution of pest resistance threatens the benefits of genetically engineered crops 
      that produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins. Strategies intended 
      to delay pest resistance are most effective when implemented proactively. 
      Accordingly, researchers have selected for and analyzed resistance to Bt toxins in 
      many laboratory strains of pests before resistance evolves in the field, but the 
      utility of this approach depends on the largely untested assumption that laboratory- 
      and field-selected resistance to Bt toxins are similar. Here we compared the genetic 
      basis of resistance to Bt toxin Cry2Ab, which is widely deployed in transgenic 
      crops, between laboratory- and field-selected populations of the pink bollworm 
      (Pectinophora gossypiella), a global pest of cotton. We discovered that resistance 
      to Cry2Ab is associated with mutations disrupting the same ATP-binding cassette 
      transporter gene (PgABCA2) in a laboratory-selected strain from Arizona, USA, and in 
      field-selected populations from India. The most common mutation, loss of exon 6 
      caused by alternative splicing, occurred in resistant larvae from both locations. 
      Together with previous data, the results imply that mutations in the same gene 
      confer Bt resistance in laboratory- and field-selected strains and suggest that 
      focusing on ABCA2 genes may help to accelerate progress in monitoring and managing 
      resistance to Cry2Ab.

AB  - Lipids in extracellular matrices (ECM) contribute to barrier function and stability 
      of epithelial tissues such as the pulmonary alveoli and the skin. In insects, skin 
      waterproofness depends on the outermost layer of the extracellular cuticle termed 
      envelope that contains cuticulin, an unidentified water-repellent complex molecule 
      composed of proteins, lipids and catecholamines. Based on live-imaging analyses of 
      fruit fly larvae, we find that initially envelope units are assembled within 
      putative vesicles harbouring the ABC transporter Snu and the extracellular protein 
      Snsl. In a second step, the content of these vesicles is distributed to cuticular 
      lipid-transporting nanotubes named pore canals and to the cuticle surface in 
      dependence of Snu function. Consistently, the surface of snu and snsl mutant larvae 
      is depleted from lipids and cuticulin. By consequence, these animals suffer 
      uncontrolled water loss and penetration of xenobiotics. Our data allude to a 
      two-step model of envelope i.e. barrier formation. The proposed mechanism in 
      principle parallels the events occurring during differentiation of the lipid-based 
      ECM by keratinocytes in the vertebrate skin suggesting establishment of analogous 
      mechanisms of skin barrier formation in vertebrates and invertebrates.

TI  - Persistent One-Way Walking in a Circular Arena in Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S 
      Strain.
PG  - 80-93
LID - 10.1007/s10519-017-9881-z [doi]
AB  - We describe persistent one-way walking of Drosophila melanogaster in a circular 
      arena. Wild-type Canton-S adult flies walked in one direction, counter-clockwise or 
      clockwise, for minutes, whereas white-eyed mutant [Formula: see text] changed 
      directions frequently. Locomotion in the circular arena could be classified into 
      four components: counter-clockwise walking, clockwise walking, nondirectional 
      walking and pausing. Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic 
      background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of 
      one-way (including counter-clockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the 
      white ([Formula: see text]) locus promoted persistent one-way walking by increasing 
      the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of [Formula: see 
      text] was further supported by the observations that (1) [Formula: see text] 
      duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on 
      the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased 
      the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of [Formula: see 
      text] in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes. These 
      results suggested a pleiotropic function of [Formula: see text] in promoting 
      persistent one-way walking in the circular arena.

TI  - Tissue-specific transcriptome profiling of Plutella xylostella third instar larval 
      midgut.
PG  - 1142-55
LID - 10.7150/ijbs.4588 [doi]
AB  - The larval midgut of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is a dynamic tissue that 
      interfaces with a diverse array of physiological and toxicological processes, 
      including nutrient digestion and allocation, xenobiotic detoxification, innate and 
      adaptive immune response, and pathogen defense. Despite its enormous agricultural 
      importance, the genomic resources for P. xylostella are surprisingly scarce. In this 
      study, a Bt resistant P. xylostella strain was subjected to the in-depth 
      transcriptome analysis to identify genes and gene networks putatively involved in 
      various physiological and toxicological processes in the P. xylostella larval 
      midgut. Using Illumina deep sequencing, we obtained roughly 40 million reads 
      containing approximately 3.6 gigabases of sequence data. De novo assembly generated 
      63,312 ESTs with an average read length of 416 bp, and approximately half of the P. 
      xylostella sequences (45.4%, 28,768) showed similarity to the non-redundant database 
      in GenBank with a cut-off E-value below 10(-5). Among them, 11,092 unigenes were 
      assigned to one or multiple GO terms and 16,732 unigenes were assigned to 226 
      specific pathways. In-depth analysis identified genes putatively involved in 
      insecticide resistance, nutrient digestion, and innate immune defense. Besides 
      conventional detoxification enzymes and insecticide targets, novel genes, including 
      28 chymotrypsins and 53 ABC transporters, have been uncovered in the P. xylostella 
      larval midgut transcriptome; which are potentially linked to the Bt toxicity and 
      resistance. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high number of ESTs, including 46 serpins 
      and 7 lysozymes, were predicted to be involved in the immune defense.As the first 
      tissue-specific transcriptome analysis of P. xylostella, this study sheds light on 
      the molecular understanding of insecticide resistance, especially Bt resistance in 
      an agriculturally important insect pest, and lays the foundation for future 
      functional genomics research. In addition, current sequencing effort greatly 
      enriched the existing P. xylostella EST database, and makes RNAseq a viable option 
      in the future genomic analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to the carbamate insecticide bendiocarb is emerging in 
      Anopheles gambiae populations from the city of Yaoundé in Cameroon. However, the 
      molecular basis of this resistance remains uncharacterized. The present study 
      objective is to investigate mechanisms promoting resistance to bendiocarb in An. 
      gambiae populations from Yaoundé. METHODS: The level of susceptibility of An. 
      gambiae s.l. to bendiocarb 0.1 % was assessed from 2010 to 2013 using bioassays. 
      Mosquitoes resistant to bendiocarb, unexposed and susceptible mosquitoes were 
      screened for the presence of the Ace-1(R) mutation using TaqMan assays. Microarray 
      analyses were performed to assess the pattern of genes differentially expressed 
      between resistant, unexposed and susceptible. RESULTS: Bendiocarb resistance was 
      more prevalent in mosquitoes originating from cultivated sites compared to those 
      from polluted and unpolluted sites. Both An. gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii were 
      found to display resistance to bendiocarb. No G119S mutation was detected suggesting 
      that resistance was mainly metabolic. Microarray analysis revealed the 
      over-expression of several cytochrome P450 s genes including cyp6z3, cyp6z1, 
      cyp12f2, cyp6m3 and cyp6p4. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis supported the 
      detoxification role of cytochrome P450 s with several GO terms associated with P450 
      activity significantly enriched in resistant samples. Other detoxification genes 
      included UDP-glucosyl transferases, glutathione-S transferases and ABC transporters. 
      CONCLUSION: The study highlights the probable implication of metabolic mechanisms in 
      bendiocarb resistance in An. gambiae populations from Yaoundé and stresses the need 
      for further studies leading to functional validation of detoxification genes 
      involved in this resistance.

AB  - Drosophila adults display an unwillingness to enter confined spaces but the 
      behaviors induced by spatial restriction in Drosophila are largely unknown. We 
      developed a protocol for high-throughput analysis of locomotion and characterized 
      features of locomotion in a restricted space. We observed intense and persistent 
      locomotion of flies in small circular arenas (diameter 1.27 cm), whereas locomotion 
      was greatly reduced in large circular arenas (diameter 3.81 cm). The increased 
      locomotion induced by spatial restriction was seen in male flies but not female 
      flies, indicating sexual dimorphism of the response to spatial restriction. In large 
      arenas, male flies increased locomotion in arenas previously occupied by male but 
      not female individuals. In small arenas, such pre-conditioning had no effect on male 
      flies, which showed intense and persistent locomotion similar to that seen in fresh 
      arenas. During locomotion with spatial restriction, wildtype Canton-S males traveled 
      slower and with less variation in speed than the mutant w1118 carrying a null allele 
      of white gene. In addition, wildtype flies showed a stronger preference for the 
      boundary than the mutant in small arenas. Genetic analysis with a series of crosses 
      revealed that the white gene was not associated with the phenotype of boundary 
      preference in wildtype flies.

AB  - Steroid hormones are a large family of cholesterol derivatives regulating 
      development and physiology in both the animal and plant kingdoms, but little is 
      known concerning mechanisms of their secretion from steroidogenic tissues. Here, we 
      present evidence that in Drosophila, endocrine release of the steroid hormone 
      ecdysone is mediated through a regulated vesicular trafficking mechanism. Inhibition 
      of calcium signaling in the steroidogenic prothoracic gland results in the 
      accumulation of unreleased ecdysone, and the knockdown of calcium-mediated vesicle 
      exocytosis components in the gland caused developmental defects due to deficiency of 
      ecdysone. Accumulation of synaptotagmin-labeled vesicles in the gland is observed 
      when calcium signaling is disrupted, and these vesicles contain an ABC transporter 
      that functions as an ecdysone pump to fill vesicles. We propose that trafficking of 
      steroid hormones out of endocrine cells is not always through a simple diffusion 
      mechanism as presently thought, but instead can involve a regulated vesicle-mediated 
      release process.

TI  - A chromosome-level genome of the spider Trichonephila antipodiana reveals the 
      genetic basis of its polyphagy and evidence of an ancient whole-genome duplication 
      event.
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giab016 [doi]
LID - giab016
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spider Trichonephila antipodiana (Araneidae), commonly known as the 
      batik golden web spider, preys on arthropods with body sizes ranging from ∼2 mm in 
      length to insects larger than itself (>20‒50 mm), indicating its polyphagy and 
      strong dietary detoxification abilities. Although it has been reported that an 
      ancient whole-genome duplication event occurred in spiders, lack of a high-quality 
      genome has limited characterization of this event. RESULTS: We present a 
      chromosome-level T. antipodiana genome constructed on the basis of PacBio and Hi-C 
      sequencing. The assembled genome is 2.29 Gb in size with a scaffold N50 of 172.89 
      Mb. Hi-C scaffolding assigned 98.5% of the bases to 13 pseudo-chromosomes, and BUSCO 
      completeness analysis revealed that the assembly included 94.8% of the complete 
      arthropod universal single-copy orthologs (n = 1,066). Repetitive elements account 
      for 59.21% of the genome. We predicted 19,001 protein-coding genes, of which 96.78% 
      were supported by transcriptome-based evidence and 96.32% matched protein records in 
      the UniProt database. The genome also shows substantial expansions in several 
      detoxification-associated gene families, including cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases, 
      carboxyl/cholinesterases, glutathione-S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette 
      transporters, reflecting the possible genomic basis of polyphagy. Further analysis 
      of the T. antipodiana genome architecture reveals an ancient whole-genome 
      duplication event, based on 2 lines of evidence: (i) large-scale duplications from 
      inter-chromosome synteny analysis and (ii) duplicated clusters of Hox genes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The high-quality T. antipodiana genome represents a valuable resource 
      for spider research and provides insights into this species' adaptation to the 
      environment.

TI  - MAPK-Activated Transcription Factor PxJun Suppresses PxABCB1 Expression and Confers 
      Resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac Toxin in Plutella xylostella (L.).
PG  - e0046621

AB  - Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying insect resistance to Cry toxins 
      produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is pivotal for the sustainable utilization 
      of Bt biopesticides and transgenic Bt crops. Previously, we identified that 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated reduced expression of the PxABCB1 
      gene is associated with Bt Cry1Ac resistance in the diamondback moth, Plutella 
      xylostella (L.). However, the underlying transcriptional regulation mechanism 
      remains enigmatic. Here, the PxABCB1 promoter in Cry1Ac-susceptible and 
      Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella strains was cloned and analyzed and found to contain 
      a putative Jun binding site (JBS). A dual-luciferase reporter assay and yeast 
      one-hybrid assay demonstrated that the transcription factor PxJun repressed PxABCB1 
      expression by interacting with this JBS. The expression levels of PxJun were 
      increased in the midguts of all resistant strains compared to the susceptible 
      strain. Silencing of PxJun expression significantly elevated PxABCB1 expression and 
      Cry1Ac susceptibility in the resistant NIL-R strain, and silencing of PxMAP4K4 
      expression decreased PxJun expression and also increased PxABCB1 expression. These 
      results indicate that MAPK-activated PxJun suppresses PxABCB1 expression to confer 
      Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella, deepening our understanding of the 
      transcriptional regulation of midgut Cry receptor genes and the molecular basis of 
      insect resistance to Bt Cry toxins. IMPORTANCE The transcriptional regulation 
      mechanisms underlying reduced expression of Bt toxin receptor genes in Bt-resistant 
      insects remain elusive. This study unveils that a transcription factor PxJun 
      activated by the MAPK signaling pathway represses PxABCB1 expression and confers 
      Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella. Our results provide new insights into the 
      transcriptional regulation mechanisms of midgut Cry receptor genes and deepen our 
      understanding of the molecular basis of insect resistance to Bt Cry toxins. To our 
      knowledge, this study identified the first transcription factor that can be involved 
      in the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of midgut Cry receptor genes in 
      Bt-resistant insects.

TI  - Regulation mechanism of silkworm pupa oil PUFAs on cholesterol metabolism in hepatic 
      cell L-02.
PG  - 1418-1425
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.10115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Silkworm pupa oil polyunsaturated fatty acid (SPO PUFA) has been 
      confirmed to have a cholesterol-lowering function. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect 
      of SPO PUFA and its main component, α-linolenic acid (ALA), on the metabolism of 
      cholesterol and its regulation was investigated. The model of lipid denatured cells 
      were constructed to carry out lipid accumulation, cholesterol metabolism and 
      transformation. Real-time PCR and western blots were also used to analyze the 
      expression levels of related genes and proteins to investigate the cholesterol 
      efflux regulation mechanism. The data indicated that SPO PUFA and ALA 
      dose-dependently decreased intracellular total cholesterol (TC) and enhanced total 
      bile acid (TBA). They could also promote cholesterol removal by enhancing bile acid 
      secretion and by upregulating genes LXRα, PPARγ, ABCA1, ABCG1, and CYP7A1, which 
      were regulated by LXRα/PPARγ-ABCA1/ABCG1-CYP7A1 nuclear receptor signal pathways. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is of great significance in maintaining the balance of 
      cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and in reducing the risk of steatohepatitis. ©

TI  - Role of the ABC transporter Mdr49 in Hedgehog signaling and germ cell migration.
PG  - 2111-20
LID - 10.1242/dev.133587 [doi]
AB  - Coalescence of the embryonic gonad in Drosophila melanogaster requires directed 
      migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) towards somatic gonadal precursor cells 
      (SGPs). It was recently proposed that the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
      Mdr49 functions in the embryonic mesoderm to facilitate the transmission of the PGC 
      attractant from the SGPs; however, the precise molecular identity of the 
      Mdr49-dependent guidance signal remained elusive. Employing the loss- and 
      gain-of-function strategies, we show that Mdr49 is a component of the Hedgehog (hh) 
      pathway and it potentiates the signaling activity. This function is direct because 
      in Mdr49 mutant embryos the Hh ligand is inappropriately sequestered in the 
      hh-expressing cells. Our data also suggest that the role of Mdr49 is to provide 
      cholesterol for the correct processing of the Hh precursor protein. Supporting this 
      conclusion, PGC migration defects in Mdr49 embryos are substantially ameliorated by 
      a cholesterol-rich diet.

AB  - Many insect pigments are localized in subcellular pigment granules, and transport of 
      pigment precursors from the cytoplasm is accomplished by ABC proteins. Drosophila 
      melanogaster has three half-transporter genes (white, scarlet, and brown, all 
      affecting eye pigments) and Bombyx mori has a fourth (ok). The White, Brown, Scarlet 
      and Ok proteins each have one transmembrane and one cytoplasmic domain and they 
      heterodimerize to form functional transporters with different substrate 
      specificities. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create somatic and germ-line knockout 
      mutations of these four genes in the noctuid moth Helicoverpa armigera. Somatic 
      knockouts of white block pigmentation of the egg, first instar larva and adult eye, 
      but germ-line knockouts of white are recessive lethal in the embryo. Knockouts of 
      scarlet are viable and produce pigmentless first instar larvae and yellow adult eyes 
      lacking xanthommatin. Knockouts of brown show no phenotypic effects on viability or 
      pigmentation. Knockouts of ok are viable and produce translucent larval cuticle and 
      black eyes. CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations are a useful tool for analyzing how 
      essential and non-essential genes interact to produce the diversity of insect 
      pigmentation patterns found in nature.

TI  - Mining and fine-tuning sugar uptake system for titer improvement of milbemycins in 
      Streptomyces bingchenggensis.
PG  - 214-221
LID - 10.1016/j.synbio.2020.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Dramatic decrease of sugar uptake is a general phenomenon in Streptomyces at 
      stationary phase, when antibiotics are extensively produced. Milbemycins produced by 
      Streptomyces bingchenggensis are a group of valuable macrolide biopesticides, while 
      the low yield and titer impede their broad applications in agricultural field. 
      Considering that inadequate sugar uptake generally hinders titer improvement of 
      desired products, we mined the underlying sugar uptake systems and fine-tuned their 
      expression in this work. First, we screened the candidates at both genomic and 
      transcriptomic level in S. bingchenggensis. Then, two ATP-binding cassette 
      transporters named TP2 and TP5 were characterized to improve milbemycin titer and 
      yield significantly. Next, the appropriate native temporal promoters were selected 
      and used to tune the expression of TP2 and TP5, resulting in a maximal milbemycin 
      A3/A4 titer increase by 36.9% to 3321 mg/L. Finally, TP2 and TP5 were broadly 
      fine-tuned in another two macrolide biopesticide producers Streptomyces avermitilis 
      and Streptomyces cyaneogriseus, leading to a maximal titer improvement of 34.1% and 
      52.6% for avermectin B(1a) and nemadectin, respectively. This work provides useful 
      transporter tools and corresponding engineering strategy for Streptomyces.

TI  - Heterocyclic cyclohexanone monocarbonyl analogs of curcumin can inhibit the activity 
      of ATP-binding cassette transporters in cancer multidrug resistance.

AB  - Curcumin (CUR) is a phytochemical that inhibits the xenobiotic ABC efflux 
      transporters implicated in cancer multidrug resistance (MDR), such as P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated 
      proteins 1 and 5 (MRP1 and MRP5). The use of CUR in the clinic however, is 
      complicated by its instability and poor pharmacokinetic profile. Monocarbonyl 
      analogs of CUR (MACs) are compounds without CUR's unstable β-diketone moiety and 
      were reported to have improved stability and in vivo disposition. Whether the MACs 
      can be used as MDR reversal agents is less clear, as the absence of a β-diketone may 
      negatively impact transporter inhibition. In this study, we investigated 23 
      heterocyclic cyclohexanone MACs for inhibitory effects against P-gp, BCRP, MRP1 and 
      MRP5. Using flow cytometry and resistance reversal assays, we found that many of 
      these compounds inhibited the transport activity of the ABC transporters 
      investigated, often with much greater potency than CUR. Overall the analogs were 
      most effective at inhibiting BCRP and we identified three compounds, A12 
      (2,6-bis((E)-2,5-dimethoxy-benzylidene)cyclohexanone), A13 
      (2,6-bis((E)-4-hydroxyl-3-methoxybenzylidene)-cyclohexanone) and B11 
      (3,5-bis((E)-2-fluoro-4,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)-1-methylpiperidin-4-one), as the 
      most promising BCRP inhibitors. These compounds inhibited BCRP activity in a 
      non-cell line, non-substrate-specific manner. Their inhibition occurred by direct 
      transporter interaction rather than modulating protein or cell surface expression. 
      From these results, we concluded that MACs, such as the heterocyclic cyclohexanone 
      analogs in this study, also have potential as MDR reversal agents and may be 
      superior alternatives to the unstable parent compound, CUR.

TI  - Mosquito-borne heartworm Dirofilaria immitis in dogs from Australia.
PG  - 535
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1821-x [doi]
LID - 535
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) in dogs is considered endemic in 
      Australia, but the clinical heartworm disease caused by the heartworm is rare and 
      prevalence is low. The mainstream prevention of the heartworm is based on 
      macrocyclic lactone (ML) administration. The aim of this study was to confirm 
      endemism of the heartworm under current Australian conditions using a cohort of 
      recent microfilaria-positive dogs which were on variable heartworm prevention. 
      METHODS: A hotspot of canine heartworm antigen-positive and microfilaria-positive 
      dogs has been detected recently in Queensland, Australia. Blood samples from 39 dogs 
      from Queensland and two dogs from New South Wales were investigated for canine 
      filarioids. Rapid antigen diagnostic tests capable of detection of D. immitis and 
      real-time PCR for quantification and differentiation between D. immitis from 
      Acanthocheilonema reconditum with quantification of microfilariae in canine blood 
      samples, together with D. immitis specific real-time PCR assay, were applied to 
      microfilaria-positive dogs. The P-glycoprotein genotype was determined to test 
      whether Australian-sourced heartworm shared the same genetic markers as those 
      suspected of ML-resistance in North America. RESULTS: Only D. immitis was detected 
      in the samples from Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Using high resolution 
      melt real-time PCR and D. immitis specific real-time PCR, the calculated 
      microfilaria concentration ranged from 1 to 44,957 microfilariae/ml and from 7 to 
      60,526 microfilariae/ml, respectively. DNA sequencing of the PCR products confirmed 
      D. immitis. Fifteen of the examined dogs were on putative, rigorous ML prevention. 
      For the remaining dogs, compliance with heartworm prevention was unknown or reported 
      as inconsistent. Wild-type genotype AA-GG of the P-glycoprotein locus of D. immitis 
      sequence has been obtained for three blood samples. Due to the incomplete history, 
      any suggestion of a loss of efficacy of MLs must be treated as 'remotely possible'. 
      In the immediate future, records of preventative administration and annual antigen 
      testing would be required to determine any problems with the efficacy of 
      preventatives. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of canine heartworm in Australia remains 
      poorly understood. It is generally assumed to be low by veterinary practitioners. 
      The localised increase in the study area confirms endemism of canine heartworm and a 
      requirement for ongoing vigilance through annual heartworm testing to better 
      understand the changing distribution of canine heartworm, client compliance, as well 
      as to detect any change in ML-susceptibility.

TI  - Detoxification and stress response genes expressed in a western North American 
      bumble bee, Bombus huntii (Hymenoptera: Apidae).
PG  - 874
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-14-874 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hunt bumble bee (Bombus huntii Greene, Hymenoptera: Apidae) is a 
      holometabolous, social insect important as a pollinator in natural and agricultural 
      ecosystems in western North America. Bumble bees spend a significant amount of time 
      foraging on a wide variety of flowering plants, and this activity exposes them to 
      both plant toxins and pesticides, posing a threat to individual and colony survival. 
      Little is known about what detoxification pathways are active in bumble bees, how 
      the expression of detoxification genes changes across life stages, or how the number 
      of detoxification genes expressed in B. huntii compares to other insects. RESULTS: 
      We found B. huntii expressed at least 584 genes associated with detoxification and 
      stress responses. The expression levels of some of these genes, such as those 
      encoding the cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and glycosidases, 
      vary among different life stages to a greater extent than do other genes. We also 
      found that the number of P450s, GSTs and esterase genes expressed by B. huntii is 
      similar to the number of these genes found in the genomes of other bees, namely 
      Bombus terrestris, Bombus impatiens, Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata, but 
      many fewer than are found in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. CONCLUSIONS: Bombus 
      huntii has transcripts for a large number of detoxification and stress related 
      proteins, including oxidation and reduction enzymes, conjugation enzymes, hydrolytic 
      enzymes, ABC transporters, cadherins, and heat shock proteins. The diversity of 
      genes expressed within some detoxification pathways varies among the life stages and 
      castes, and we typically identified more genes in the adult females than in larvae, 
      pupae, or adult males, for most pathways. Meanwhile, we found the numbers of 
      detoxification and stress genes expressed by B. huntii to be more similar to other 
      bees than to the fruit fly. The low number of detoxification genes, first noted in 
      the honey bee, appears to be a common phenomenon among bees, and perhaps results 
      from their symbiotic relationship with plants. Many flowering plants benefit from 
      pollinators, and thus offer these insects rewards (such as nectar) rather than 
      defensive plant toxins.

TI  - RNA-Seq and molecular docking reveal multi-level pesticide resistance in the bed 
      bug.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-13-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are hematophagous nocturnal parasites of 
      humans that have attained high impact status due to their worldwide resurgence. The 
      sudden and rampant resurgence of C. lectularius has been attributed to numerous 
      factors including frequent international travel, narrower pest management practices, 
      and insecticide resistance. RESULTS: We performed a next-generation RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-Seq) experiment to find differentially expressed genes between 
      pesticide-resistant (PR) and pesticide-susceptible (PS) strains of C. lectularius. A 
      reference transcriptome database of 51,492 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was 
      created by combining the databases derived from de novo assembled mRNA-Seq tags 
      (30,404 ESTs) and our previous 454 pyrosequenced database (21,088 ESTs). The two-way 
      GLMseq analysis revealed ~15,000 highly significant differentially expressed ESTs 
      between the PR and PS strains. Among the top 5,000 differentially expressed ESTs, 
      109 putative defense genes (cuticular proteins, cytochrome P450s, antioxidant genes, 
      ABC transporters, glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases and acetyl 
      cholinesterase) involved in penetration resistance and metabolic resistance were 
      identified. Tissue and development-specific expression of P450 CYP3 clan members 
      showed high mRNA levels in the cuticle, Malpighian tubules, and midgut; and in early 
      instar nymphs, respectively. Lastly, molecular modeling and docking of a candidate 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP397A1V2) revealed the flexibility of the deduced protein to 
      metabolize a broad range of insecticide substrates including DDT, deltamethrin, 
      permethrin, and imidacloprid. CONCLUSIONS: We developed significant molecular 
      resources for C. lectularius putatively involved in metabolic resistance as well as 
      those participating in other modes of insecticide resistance. RNA-Seq profiles of PR 
      strains combined with tissue-specific profiles and molecular docking revealed 
      multi-level insecticide resistance in C. lectularius. Future research that is 
      targeted towards RNA interference (RNAi) on the identified metabolic targets such as 
      cytochrome P450s and cuticular proteins could lay the foundation for a better 
      understanding of the genetic basis of insecticide resistance in C. lectularius.

AB  - Estrone, estradiol and estriol are endogenous human estrogens that are rapidly 
      conjugated with glucuronic acid in both intestinal and hepatic epithelial cells. The 
      resulting glucuronides, estrone-3-glucuronide (E(1)-G), estradiol-3- and 
      17-glucuronides (E(2)-3G and E(2)-17G), as well as estriol-3- and 16-glucuronides 
      (E(3)-3G and E(3)-16G) are found in human plasma and urine. Unlike E(2)-17G, the 
      efflux transport of other estrogen glucuronides by human transporters has not yet 
      been investigated comprehensively. We have studied the transport of E(1)-G, E(2)-3G, 
      E(3)-3G, E(3)-16G and estrone-3-sulfate (E(1)-S), another important estrogen 
      conjugate, using the vesicular transport assay with recombinant human MRP2, MRP3, 
      MRP4, MDR1 and BCRP that were expressed in insect cells. The transport screening 
      assays revealed that whereas E(1)-S was a good and specific substrate for BCRP, the 
      less transporter-specific conjugates, E(1)-G and E(2)-3G, were still transported by 
      BCRP at 10-fold higher rates than E(1)-S. BCRP also transported E(3)-16G at higher 
      rates than the studied MRPs, while it transported E(3)-3G at lower rates than MRP3. 
      MRP2 exhibited lower or equal transport rates of E(1)-G, E(2)-3G, E(3)-3G and 
      E(3)-16G in comparison to MRP3 and BCRP in the screening assays, mainly due to its 
      high K(m) values, between 180 and 790 μM. MRP3 transported all the tested 
      glucuronides at rather similar rates, at K(m) values below 20 μM, but lower V(max) 
      values than other transporters. In the case of E(3)-3G, MRP3 was the most active 
      transporter in the screening assay. MRP4 transported only E(3)-16G at considerable 
      rates, while none of the tested estrogen conjugates was transported by MDR1 at 
      higher rates than control vesicles. These new results, in combination with 
      previously reported in vivo human data, stimulate our understanding on the substrate 
      specificity and role of efflux transporters in disposition of estrogen glucuronides 
      in humans.

AB  - Recently, the concept has arisen that a special class of architectural proteins 
      exists, which are responsible not only for global chromosome architecture but also 
      for the local regulation of enhancer-promoter interactions. Here, we describe a new 
      architectural protein, with a total size of only 375 aa, which contains an 
      N-terminal zinc finger-associated domain (ZAD) and a cluster of five zinc finger 
      C2H2 domains at the C-terminus. This new protein, named ZAD and Architectural 
      Function 1 protein (ZAF1 protein), is weakly and ubiquitously expressed, with the 
      highest expression levels observed in oocytes and embryos. The cluster of C2H2 
      domains recognizes a specific 15-bp consensus site, located predominantly in 
      promoters, near transcription start sites. The expression of ZAF1 by a 
      tissue-specific promoter led to the complete blocking of the eye enhancer when 
      clusters of ZAF1 binding sites flanked the eye enhancer in transgenic lines, 
      suggesting that the loop formed by the ZAF1 protein leads to insulation. The ZAF1 
      protein also supported long-range interactions between the yeast GAL4 activator and 
      the white promoter in transgenic Drosophila lines. A mutant protein lacking the ZAD 
      failed to block the eye enhancer or to support distance interactions in transgenic 
      lines. Taken together, these results suggest that ZAF1 is a minimal architectural 
      protein that can be used to create a convenient model for studying the mechanisms of 
      distance interactions.

      and copulation failure in Drosophila suzukii.

AB  - The Spotted-wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) is a devastating invasive pest of 
      fruit crops. In D. melanogaster, the white (w) gene was associated with pigmentation 
      and mating behavior, which are also important aspects to understand the invasion 
      biology as well as to develop control strategies for D. suzukii. Here, we show that 
      the generation of D. suzukii white-eyed mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the w 
      gene resulted in the complete failure of copulation when w(-) males were 
      individually paired with w(-) females in small circular arenas (diameter 0.7 cm) for 
      24 h. Further analysis showed that the mating defect was associated with w(-) males 
      and could not be rectified by two years of inbreeding by crossing sibling w(-) 
      females with w(+) males, dim red illumination, male-female sexual training, changing 
      to large arenas (diameter 3.5 cm), or different sex ratios. Profound pigmentation 
      deficiency was detected in the compound eyes, ocelli, Malpighian tubules and testis 
      sheaths in the w(-) flies. Specifically, testis imaging showed that w(-) males 
      failed to deposit any pigments into pigment cells of the testis sheath, and produced 
      smaller sperms and less seminal fluid compared to those from wildtype males. 
      Together these observations suggest that the w gene plays an essential role in the 
      regulation of sexual behavior and reproduction in D. suzukii. The similarities and 
      differences in w gene function between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster in the context 
      of pigmentation and mating behavior are discussed.

AB  - Insect pests cause serious crop damage and develop high-level resistance to chemical 
      insecticides and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal Cry toxins. A new 
      promising approach for controlling them and overcoming this resistance is RNA 
      interference (RNAi). The RNAi-based insect control strategy depends on the selection 
      of suitable target genes. In this study, we cloned and characterized a novel ABC 
      transporter gene PxABCH1 in diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). Phylogenetic 
      analysis showed that PxABCH1 is closely related to ABCA and ABCG subfamily members. 
      Spatial-temporal expression detection revealed that PxABCH1 was expressed in all 
      tissues and developmental stages, and highest expressed in head and male adult. 
      Midgut sequence variation and expression analyses of PxABCH1 in all the susceptible 
      and Bt-resistant P. xylostella strains and the functional analysis by sublethal RNAi 
      demonstrated that Cry1Ac resistance was independent of this gene. Silencing of 
      PxABCH1 by a relatively high dose of dsRNA dramatically reduced its expression and 
      resulted in larval and pupal lethal phenotypes in both susceptible and 
      Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella strains. To our knowledge, this study provides the 
      first insight into ABCH1 in lepidopterans and reveals it as an excellent target for 
      RNAi-based insect pest control and resistance management.

      severely affects production. Insecticides are an important means of controlling BPH, 
      but their long-term use has led to resistance. To provide insight into BPH responses 
      to insecticide stress, we determined the expression levels of BPH ABCG transporter 
      genes under treatment with thiamethoxam, abamectin, and cyantraniliprole at LC(10), 
      LC(25), LC(50), and LC(90). We cloned 13 BPH ABCG transporters, named NlABCG1 to 
      NlABCG13. Conservative domain analysis showed that all 13 transporters have one 
      nucleotide binding domain and one transmembrane domain, typical of semi-molecular 
      transporters. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that thiamethoxam, abamectin, and 
      cyantraniliprole stress increased the expression of some NlABCG transporters gene in 
      BPH. However, after treatment with thiamethoxam at LC(25) and abamectin at LC(10), 
      there was no significant upregulation of NlABCG. These results indicate that the 
      expression of NlABCG varies in response to stress from different insecticides. These 
      findings provide baseline information for further understanding of the molecular 
      mechanisms of insecticide resistance in BPH.

AB  - Optical insulation plays a critical role in the fine visual acuity of the Drosophila 
      compound eye. Screening pigments expressed by a number of cell types contribute to 
      this phenomenon. They provide optical insulation that prevents extraneous light rays 
      from inappropriately activating the photoreceptors. This optical insulation can be 
      divided into two categories; the insulation of the individual ommatidia, and the 
      insulation of the compound eye as a whole. The whole-eye insulation is provided by 
      two sources. The sides of the eye are optically insulated by the pigment rim, a band 
      of pigment cells that circumscribes the eye. The base of the eye is insulated by the 
      subretinal pigment layer; a thick layer of pigment that lies directly underneath the 
      retina. How this subretinal pigment layer is generated has not been clearly 
      described. Here, experiments that manipulate pigment expression during eye 
      development suggest that the subretinal pigment layer is directly derived from 
      pigment cells in the overlying retina.

AB  - Because Bombyx mori ABC transporter C2 (BmABCC2) has 1000-fold higher potential than 
      B. mori cadherin-like protein as a receptor for Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Aa toxin 
      (Tanaka et al., 2013), the gate-opening ability of the latent pore under six 
      extracellular loops (ECLs) of BmABCC2 was expected to be the reason for its higher 
      potential (Heckel, 2012). In this study, cell swelling assays in Sf9 cells showed 
      that BmABCC2 mutants lacking substrate-excreting activity retained receptor 
      activity, indicating that the gate-opening activity of BmABCC2 is not responsible 
      for Cry1Aa toxicity. The analysis of 29 BmABCC2 mutants demonstrated that 
      (770)DYWL(773) of ECL 4 comprise a putative binding site to Cry1Aa. This suggests 
      that specific toxicity of Cry1Aa toxin to a restricted range of lepidopteran insects 
      is dependent on conservation and variation in the amino acid residues around 
      (770)DYWL(773) of ECL 4 in the ABCC2.

TI  - Functional validation of DvABCB1 as a receptor of Cry3 toxins in western corn 
      rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera.
PG  - 15830

AB  - Western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: 
      Chrysomelidae), is a serious insect pest in the major corn growing areas of North 
      America and in parts of Europe. WCR populations with resistance to Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) toxins utilized in commercial transgenic traits have been 
      reported, raising concerns over their continued efficacy in WCR management. 
      Understanding the modes of action of Bt toxins is important for WCR control and 
      resistance management. Although different classes of proteins have been identified 
      as Bt receptors for lepidopteran insects, identification of receptors in WCR has 
      been limited with no reports of functional validation. Our results demonstrate that 
      heterologous expression of DvABCB1 in Sf9 and HEK293 cells conferred sensitivity to 
      the cytotoxic effects of Cry3A toxins. The result was further validated using 
      knockdown of DvABCB1 by RNAi which rendered WCR larvae insensitive to a Cry3A toxin. 
      However, silencing of DvABCB2 which is highly homologous to DvABCB1 at the amino 
      acid level, did not reduce the sensitivity of WCR larvae to a Cry3A toxin. 
      Furthermore, our functional studies corroborate different mode-of-actions for other 
      insecticidal proteins including Cry34Ab1/35Ab1, Cry6Aa1, and IPD072Aa against WCR. 
      Finally, reduced expression and alternatively spliced transcripts of DvABCB1 were 
      identified in a mCry3A-resistant strain of WCR. Our results provide the first clear 
      demonstration of a functional receptor in the molecular mechanism of Cry3A toxicity 
      in WCR and confirmed its role in the mechanism of resistance in a mCry3A resistant 
      strain of WCR.

AB  - Recent advances in genomic and post-genomic technologies have facilitated a 
      genome-wide analysis of the insecticide resistance-associated genes in insects. 
      Through bed bug, Cimex lectularius transcriptome analysis, we identified 14 
      molecular markers associated with pyrethroid resistance. Our studies revealed that 
      most of the resistance-associated genes functioning in diverse mechanisms are 
      expressed in the epidermal layer of the integument, which could prevent or slow down 
      the toxin from reaching the target sites on nerve cells, where an additional layer 
      of resistance (kdr) is possible. This strategy evolved in bed bugs is based on their 
      unique morphological, physiological and behavioral characteristics and has not been 
      reported in any other insect species. RNA interference-aided knockdown of resistance 
      associated genes showed the relative contribution of each mechanism towards overall 
      resistance development. Understanding the complexity of adaptive strategies employed 
      by bed bugs will help in designing the most effective and sustainable bed bug 
      control methods.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 
      participates in immune surveillance by moving proteasomal products into the 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen for major histocompatibility complex class I 
      loading and cell surface presentation to cytotoxic T cells. Here we delineate the 
      mechanistic basis for antigen translocation. Notably, TAP works as a molecular 
      diode, translocating peptide substrates against the gradient in a strict 
      unidirectional way. We reveal the importance of the D-loop at the dimer interface of 
      the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) in coupling substrate translocation with 
      ATP hydrolysis and defining transport vectoriality. Substitution of the conserved 
      aspartate, which coordinates the ATP-binding site, decreases NBD dimerization 
      affinity and turns the unidirectional primary active pump into a passive 
      bidirectional nucleotide-gated facilitator. Thus, ATP hydrolysis is not required for 
      translocation per se, but is essential for both active and unidirectional transport. 
      Our data provide detailed mechanistic insight into how heterodimeric ABC exporters 
      operate.

TI  - Zinc Detoxification: A Functional Genomics and Transcriptomics Analysis in 
      Drosophila melanogaster Cultured Cells.
PG  - 631-641

AB  - Cells require some metals, such as zinc and manganese, but excess levels of these 
      metals can be toxic. As a result, cells have evolved complex mechanisms for 
      maintaining metal homeostasis and surviving metal intoxication. Here, we present the 
      results of a large-scale functional genomic screen in Drosophila cultured cells for 
      modifiers of zinc chloride toxicity, together with transcriptomics data for 
      wild-type or genetically zinc-sensitized cells challenged with mild zinc chloride 
      supplementation. Altogether, we identified 47 genes for which knockdown conferred 
      sensitivity or resistance to toxic zinc or manganese chloride treatment, and >1800 
      putative zinc-responsive genes. Analysis of the 'omics data points to the relevance 
      of ion transporters, glutathione (GSH)-related factors, and conserved 
      disease-associated genes in zinc detoxification. Specific genes identified in the 
      zinc screen include orthologs of human disease-associated genes CTNS, PTPRN (also 
      known as IA-2), and ATP13A2 (also known as PARK9). We show that knockdown of red dog 
      mine (rdog; CG11897), a candidate zinc detoxification gene encoding an ABCC-type 
      transporter family protein related to yeast cadmium factor (YCF1), confers 
      sensitivity to zinc intoxication in cultured cells, and that rdog is 
      transcriptionally upregulated in response to zinc stress. As there are many links 
      between the biology of zinc and other metals and human health, the 'omics data sets 
      presented here provide a resource that will allow researchers to explore metal 
      biology in the context of diverse health-relevant processes.

AB  - How biochemical and mechanical information are integrated during tissue development 
      is a central question in morphogenesis. In many biological systems, the PIX-GIT 
      complex localises to focal adhesions and integrates both physical and chemical 
      information. We used Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber formation to study the 
      function of PIX and GIT orthologues (dPix and Git, respectively), and discovered a 
      central role for this complex in controlling myosin activity and epithelial 
      monolayering. We found that Git's focal adhesion targeting domain mediates basal 
      localisation of this complex to filament structures and the leading edge of 
      migrating cells. In the absence of dpix and git, tissue disruption is driven by 
      contractile forces, as reduction of myosin activators restores egg production and 
      morphology. Further, dpix and git mutant eggs closely phenocopy defects previously 
      reported in pak mutant epithelia. Together, these results indicate that the dPix-Git 
      complex controls egg chamber morphogenesis by controlling myosin contractility and 
      Pak kinase downstream of focal adhesions.

TI  - Using Drosophila melanogaster to identify chemotherapy toxicity genes.
PG  - 31-43
LID - 10.1534/genetics.114.161968 [doi]
AB  - The severity of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy shows a great deal of 
      interindividual variability, and much of this variation is likely genetically based. 
      Simple DNA tests predictive of toxic side effects could revolutionize the way 
      chemotherapy is carried out. Due to the challenges in identifying polymorphisms that 
      affect toxicity in humans, we use Drosophila fecundity following oral exposure to 
      carboplatin, gemcitabine and mitomycin C as a model system to identify naturally 
      occurring DNA variants predictive of toxicity. We use the Drosophila Synthetic 
      Population Resource (DSPR), a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a 
      multiparent advanced intercross, to map quantitative trait loci affecting 
      chemotoxicity. We identify two QTL each for carboplatin and gemcitabine toxicity and 
      none for mitomycin. One QTL is associated with fly orthologs of a priori human 
      carboplatin candidate genes ABCC2 and MSH2, and a second QTL is associated with fly 
      orthologs of human gemcitabine candidate genes RRM2 and RRM2B. The third, a 
      carboplatin QTL, is associated with a posteriori human orthologs from solute carrier 
      family 7A, INPP4A&B, and NALCN. The fourth, a gemcitabine QTL that also affects 
      methotrexate toxicity, is associated with human ortholog GPx4. Mapped QTL each 
      explain a significant fraction of variation in toxicity, yet individual SNPs and 
      transposable elements in the candidate gene regions fail to singly explain QTL 
      peaks. Furthermore, estimates of founder haplotype effects are consistent with genes 
      harboring several segregating functional alleles. We find little evidence for 
      nonsynonymous SNPs explaining mapped QTL; thus it seems likely that standing 
      variation in toxicity is due to regulatory alleles.

TI  - The Cadherin Protein Is Not Involved in Susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis 
      Cry1Ab or Cry1Fa Toxins in Spodoptera frugiperda.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12060375 [doi]
LID - 375
AB  - It is well known that insect larval midgut cadherin protein serves as a receptor of 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal Cry1Ac or Cry1Ab toxins, since structural 
      mutations and downregulation of cad gene expression are linked with resistance to 
      Cry1Ac toxin in several lepidopteran insects. However, the role of Spodoptera 
      frugiperda cadherin protein (SfCad) in the mode of action of Bt toxins remains 
      elusive. Here, we investigated whether SfCad is involved in susceptibility to Cry1Ab 
      or Cry1Fa toxins. In vivo, knockout of the SfCad gene by CRISPR/Cas 9 did not 
      increase tolerance to either of these toxins in S. frugiperda larvae. In vitro 
      cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that cultured insect TnHi5 cells expressing 
      GFP-tagged SfCad did not increase susceptibility to activated Cry1Ab or Cry1Fa 
      toxins. In contrast, expression of another well recognized Cry1A receptor in this 
      cell line, the ABCC2 transporter, increased the toxicity of both Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa 
      toxins, suggesting that SfABCC2 functions as a receptor of these toxins. Finally, we 
      showed that the toxin-binding region of SfCad did not bind to activated Cry1Ab, 
      Cry1Ac, nor Cry1Fa. All these results support that SfCad is not involved in the mode 
      of action of Cry1Ab or Cry1Fa toxins in S. frugiperda.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and malaria, which are transmitted by 
      infected female mosquitoes, affect nearly half of the world's population. The 
      emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquito populations is reducing the 
      effectiveness of conventional insecticides and threatening current vector control 
      strategies, which has created an urgent need to identify new molecular targets 
      against which novel classes of insecticides can be developed. We previously 
      demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors of mammalian Kir channels represent 
      promising chemicals for new mosquitocide development. In this study, high-throughput 
      screening of approximately 30,000 chemically diverse small-molecules was employed to 
      discover potent and selective inhibitors of Aedes aegypti Kir1 (AeKir1) channels 
      heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. Of 283 confirmed screening 'hits', the 
      small-molecule inhibitor VU625 was selected for lead optimization and in vivo 
      studies based on its potency and selectivity toward AeKir1, and tractability for 
      medicinal chemistry. In patch clamp electrophysiology experiments of HEK293 cells, 
      VU625 inhibits AeKir1 with an IC50 value of 96.8 nM, making VU625 the most potent 
      inhibitor of AeKir1 described to date. Furthermore, electrophysiology experiments in 
      Xenopus oocytes revealed that VU625 is a weak inhibitor of AeKir2B. Surprisingly, 
      injection of VU625 failed to elicit significant effects on mosquito behavior, urine 
      excretion, or survival. However, when co-injected with probenecid, VU625 inhibited 
      the excretory capacity of mosquitoes and was toxic, suggesting that the compound is 
      a substrate of organic anion and/or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The 
      dose-toxicity relationship of VU625 (when co-injected with probenecid) is biphasic, 
      which is consistent with the molecule inhibiting both AeKir1 and AeKir2B with 
      different potencies. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that potent and highly 
      selective inhibitors of mosquito Kir channels can be developed using conventional 
      drug discovery approaches. Furthermore, it reinforces the notion that the physical 
      and chemical properties that determine a compound's bioavailability in vivo will be 
      critical in determining the efficacy of Kir channel inhibitors as insecticides.

AB  - Multidrug resistance associated protein-2, MRP2 (human), Mrp2 (rat) are an efflux 
      transporter, responsible for the transport of numerous endogenous and xenobiotic 
      compounds including taurocholate, methotrexate and carboxydichlorofluorescein (CDF). 
      The present study aims to characterise transport of statins by human and rat 
      MRP2/Mrp2 using membrane and vesicle preparations. All statins tested (simvastatin, 
      pravastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin and rosuvastatin) 
      stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in membranes expressing human or rat 
      MRP2/Mrp2, suggesting that all statins are substrates of human and rat MRP2/Mrp2. 
      The substrate affinity (Km) of all statins for MRP2/Mrp2 was comparable and no 
      correlation between lipophilicity (logD7.0) and Km was seen. All statins also 
      inhibited uptake of the fluorescent Mrp2 substrate, CDF (1μM) into vesicles 
      expressing human or rat MRP2/Mrp2 with similar IC50 values. Fitting of the 
      inhibitory data to the hill slope equation, gave hill coefficients (h) of greater 
      than one, suggesting that transport involved more than one binding site for 
      inhibitors of MPR2 and Mrp2. We conclude that statins were transported by both human 
      and rat MRP2/Mrp2 with similar affinity. Statins were also shown to compete with 
      other substrates for transport by MRP2/Mrp2 and that this transport involved more 
      than one binding site on the Mrp2/MRP2 protein.

TI  - RNA-Seq reveals a xenobiotic stress response in the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, 
      when fed aphid-resistant soybean.
PG  - 972

AB  - BACKGROUND: While much recent research has expanded our understanding of the 
      molecular interactions between aphids and their host plants, it is lacking for the 
      soybean aphid, Aphis glycines. Since its North American invasion, A. glycines has 
      become one of the most damaging insect pests on this important crop. Five soybean 
      genes for host plant resistance to A. glycines have been identified, but populations 
      of A. glycines have already adapted to overcome these resistance genes. 
      Understanding the molecular interactions between resistant soybean and A. glycines 
      can provide clues to its adaptation mechanisms. Here, we used RNA-Sequencing to 
      compare and contrast A. glycines gene expression when fed resistant (Rag1) and 
      susceptible soybean. RESULTS: Combining results from a previous A. glycines 
      transcriptome, we generated 64,860 high quality transcripts, totaling 41,151,086 
      bases. Statistical analysis revealed 914 genes with significant differential 
      expression. Most genes with higher expression in A. glycines on resistant plants (N 
      = 352) were related to stress and detoxification such as cytochrome P450s, 
      glutathione-S-transferases, carboxyesterases, and ABC transporters. A total of 562 
      genes showed lower transcript abundance in A. glycines on resistant plants. From our 
      extensive transcriptome data, we also identified genes encoding for putative 
      salivary effector proteins (N = 73). Among these, 6 effector genes have lower 
      transcript abundance in A. glycines feeding on resistant soybean. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, A. glycines exhibited a pattern typical of xenobiotic challenge, thereby 
      validating antibiosis in Rag1, presumably mediated through toxic secondary 
      metabolites. Additionally, this study identified many A. glycines genes and gene 
      families at the forefront of its molecular interaction with soybean. Further 
      investigation of these genes in other biotypes may reveal adaptation mechanisms to 
      resistant plants.

AB  - Many insect species exhibit pesticide-resistant phenotypes. One of the mechanisms 
      capable of contributing to resistance is the overexpression of multidrug resistance 
      (MDR) transporter proteins. Here we describe the cloning of three genes encoding MDR 
      proteins from Trichoplusia ni: trnMDR1, trnMDR2 and trnMDR3. Real-time quantitative 
      PCR (qPCR) detected trnMDR mRNA in the whole nervous system, midgut and Malpighian 
      tubules of final instar T. ni caterpillars. To test whether these genes are 
      upregulated in response to chemical challenge in this insect, qPCR was used to 
      compare trnMDR mRNA levels in unchallenged insects with those of insects fed the 
      synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin. Only limited increases were detected in a single 
      gene, trnMDR2, which is the most weakly expressed of the three MDR genes, suggesting 
      that increased multidrug resistance of this type is not a significant part of the 
      response to deltamethrin exposure.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) function is dependent on the stringent regulation of 
      metabolites, drugs, cells, and pathogens exposed to the CNS space. Cellular 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) structures are highly specific checkpoints governing entry 
      and exit of all small molecules to and from the brain interstitial space, but the 
      precise mechanisms that regulate the BBB are not well understood. In addition, the 
      BBB has long been a challenging obstacle to the pharmacologic treatment of CNS 
      diseases; thus model systems that can parse the functions of the BBB are highly 
      desirable. In this study, we sought to define the transcriptome of the adult 
      Drosophila melanogaster BBB by isolating the BBB surface glia with fluorescence 
      activated cell sorting (FACS) and profiling their gene expression with microarrays. 
      By comparing the transcriptome of these surface glia to that of all brain glia, 
      brain neurons, and whole brains, we present a catalog of transcripts that are 
      selectively enriched at the Drosophila BBB. We found that the fly surface glia show 
      high expression of many ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) 
      transporters, cell adhesion molecules, metabolic enzymes, signaling molecules, and 
      components of xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Using gene sequence-based alignments, 
      we compare the Drosophila and Murine BBB transcriptomes and discover many shared 
      chemoprotective and small molecule control pathways, thus affirming the relevance of 
      invertebrate models for studying evolutionary conserved BBB properties. The 
      Drosophila BBB transcriptome is valuable to vertebrate and insect biologists alike 
      as a resource for studying proteins underlying diffusion barrier development and 
      maintenance, glial biology, and regulation of drug transport at tissue barriers.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) toxins are increasingly used for mosquito 
      control, but little is known about the precise mode of action of each of these 
      toxins, and how they interact to kill mosquito larvae. By using RNA sequencing, we 
      investigated change in gene transcription level and polymorphism variations 
      associated with resistance to each Bti Cry toxin and to the full Bti toxin mixture 
      in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. The up-regulation of genes related to chitin 
      metabolism in all selected strain suggests a generalist, non-toxin-specific response 
      to Bti selection in Aedes aegypti. Changes in the transcription level and/or protein 
      sequences of several putative Cry toxin receptors (APNs, ALPs, α-amylases, glucoside 
      hydrolases, ABC transporters) were specific to each Cry toxin. Selective sweeps 
      associated with Cry4Aa resistance were detected in 2 ALP and 1 APN genes. The lack 
      of selection of toxin-specific receptors in the Bti-selected strain supports the 
      hypothesis that Cyt toxin acts as a receptor for Cry toxins in mosquitoes.

AB  - ABCA4 is a member of the A subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters that 
      consists of large integral membrane proteins implicated in inherited human diseases. 
      ABCA4 assists in the clearance of N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine, a 
      potentially toxic by-product of the visual cycle formed in photoreceptor cells 
      during light perception. Structural and functional studies of this protein have been 
      hindered by its large size, membrane association, and domain complexity. Although 
      mammalian, insect and bacterial systems have been used for expression of ABCA4 and 
      its individual domains, the structural relevance of resulting proteins to the native 
      transporter has yet to be established. We produced soluble domains of ABCA4 in 
      Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the full-length transporter in 
      HEK293 cells. Electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography were used to 
      assess the conformational homogeneity and structure of these proteins. We found that 
      isolated ABCA4 domains formed large, heterogeneous oligomers cross-linked with 
      non-specific disulphide bonds. Incomplete folding of cytoplasmic domain 2 was 
      proposed based on fluorescence spectroscopy results. In contrast, full-length human 
      ABCA4 produced in mammalian cells was found structurally equivalent to the native 
      protein obtained from bovine photoreceptors. These findings offer recombinantly 
      expressed full-length ABCA4 as an appropriate object for future detailed structural 
      and functional characterization.

LID - bio047043
AB  - We previously identified the Drosophila yata mutant, which showed phenotypes 
      including progressive vacuolization of the white-coloured compound eye, progressive 
      shrinkage of the brain and a shortened lifespan. The yata gene was shown to be 
      involved in controlling intracellular trafficking of the Amyloid precursor 
      protein-like protein, which is an orthologue of Amyloid precursor protein, which is 
      a causative molecule of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we examined the 
      phenotype of the compound eye of the yata mutant using electron microscopy and 
      confocal microscopy. We found that abnormal cellular structures that seemed to 
      originate from bleb-like structures and contained vesicles and organelles, such as 
      multivesicular bodies and autophagosomes, were observed in aged white; yata mutants 
      and aged white mutants. These structures were not observed in newly eclosed flies 
      and the presence of the structures was suppressed in flies grown under constant dark 
      conditions after eclosion. The structures were not observed in newly eclosed 
      red-eyed yata mutants or wild-type flies, but were observed in very aged red-eyed 
      wild-type flies. Thus, our data suggest that the observed structures are formed as a 
      result of changes associated with exposure to light after eclosion in white mutants, 
      white; yata mutants and aged flies.

AB  - In order to study the role played by cellular RNA pools produced by homologous 
      genomic loci in defining the transcriptional state of a silenced gene, we tested the 
      effect of non-functional alleles of the white gene in the presence of a functional 
      copy of white, silenced by heterochromatin. We found that non-functional alleles of 
      white, unable to produce a coding transcript, could reactivate in trans the 
      expression of a wild type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. This 
      new epigenetic phenomenon of transcriptional trans-reactivation is heritable, relies 
      on the presence of homologous RNA's and is affected by mutations in genes involved 
      in post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our data suggest a general new unexpected 
      level of gene expression control mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context 
      of heterochromatic genes.

TI  - Differences in midgut transcriptomes between resistant and susceptible strains of 
      Chilo suppressalis to Cry1C toxin.
PG  - 634
LID - 10.1186/s12864-020-07051-6 [doi]
LID - 634
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chilo suppressalis is a widespread rice pest that poses a major threat 
      to food security in China. This pest can develop resistance to Cry toxins from 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), threatening the sustainable use of insect-resistant 
      transgenic Bt rice. However, the molecular basis for the resistance mechanisms of C. 
      suppressalis to Cry1C toxin remains unknown. This study aimed to identify genes 
      associated with the mechanism of Cry1C resistance in C. suppressalis by comparing 
      the midgut transcriptomic responses of resistant and susceptible C. suppressalis 
      strains to Cry1C toxin and to provide information for insect resistance management. 
      RESULTS: A C. suppressalis midgut transcriptome of 139,206 unigenes was de novo 
      assembled from 373 million Illumina HiSeq and Roche 454 clean reads. Comparative 
      analysis identified 5328 significantly differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) 
      between C. suppressalis Cry1C-resistant and -susceptible strains. DEGs encoding Bt 
      Cry toxin receptors, aminopeptidase-P like protein, the ABC subfamily and alkaline 
      phosphatase were downregulated, suggesting an association with C. suppressalis Cry1C 
      resistance. Additionally, Cry1C resistance in C. suppressalis may be related to 
      changes in the transcription levels of enzymes involved in hydrolysis, digestive, 
      catalytic and detoxification processes. CONCLUSION: Our study identified genes 
      potentially involved in Cry1C resistance in C. suppressalis by comparative 
      transcriptome analysis. The assembled and annotated transcriptome data provide 
      valuable genomic resources for further study of the molecular mechanisms of C. 
      suppressalis resistance to Cry toxins.

TI  - ABCC transporters mediate insect resistance to multiple Bt toxins revealed by bulk 
      segregant analysis.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/1741-7007-12-46 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relatively recent evidence indicates that ABCC2 transporters play a main 
      role in the mode of action of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1A-type proteins. 
      Mapping of major Cry1A resistance genes has linked resistance to the ABCC2 locus in 
      Heliothis virescens, Plutella xylostella, Trichoplusia ni and Bombyx mori, and 
      mutations in this gene have been found in three of these Bt-resistant strains. 
      RESULTS: We have used a colony of Spodoptera exigua (Xen-R) highly resistant to a Bt 
      commercial bioinsecticide to identify regions in the S. exigua genome containing 
      loci for major resistance genes by using bulk segregant analysis (BSA). Results 
      reveal a region containing three genes from the ABCC family (ABBC1, ABBC2 and ABBC3) 
      and a mutation in one of them (ABBC2) as responsible for the resistance of S. exigua 
      to the Bt commercial product and to its key Spodoptera-active ingredients, Cry1Ca. 
      In contrast to all previously described mutations in ABCC2 genes that directly or 
      indirectly affect the extracellular domains of the membrane protein, the ABCC2 
      mutation found in S. exigua affects an intracellular domain involved in ATP binding. 
      Functional analyses of ABBC2 and ABBC3 support the role of both proteins in the mode 
      of action of Bt toxins in S. exigua. Partial silencing of these genes with dsRNA 
      decreased the susceptibility of wild type larvae to both Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. In 
      addition, reduction of ABBC2 and ABBC3 expression negatively affected some fitness 
      components and induced up-regulation of arylphorin and repat5, genes that respond to 
      Bt intoxication and that are found constitutively up-regulated in the Xen-R strain. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current results show the involvement of different members of the 
      ABCC family in the mode of action of B. thuringiensis proteins and expand the role 
      of the ABCC2 transporter in B. thuringiensis resistance beyond the Cry1A family of 
      proteins to include Cry1Ca.

TI  - A scaffold-level genome assembly of a minute pirate bug, Orius laevigatus 
      (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), and a comparative analysis of insecticide 
      resistance-related gene families with hemipteran crop pests.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12864-021-08249-y [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orius laevigatus, a minute pirate bug, is a highly effective beneficial 
      predator of crop pests including aphids, spider mites and thrips in integrated pest 
      management (IPM) programmes. No genomic information is currently available for O. 
      laevigatus, as is the case for the majority of beneficial predators which feed on 
      crop pests. In contrast, genomic information for crop pests is far more readily 
      available. The lack of publicly available genomes for beneficial predators to date 
      has limited our ability to perform comparative analyses of genes encoding potential 
      insecticide resistance mechanisms between crop pests and their predators. These 
      mechanisms include several gene/protein families including cytochrome P450s (P450s), 
      ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 
      UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) and carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs). METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: In this study, a high-quality scaffold level de novo genome assembly for 
      O. laevigatus has been generated using a hybrid approach with PacBio long-read and 
      Illumina short-read data. The final assembly achieved a scaffold N50 of 125,649 bp 
      and a total genome size of 150.98 Mb. The genome assembly achieved a level of 
      completeness of 93.6% using a set of 1658 core insect genes present as full-length 
      genes. Genome annotation identified 15,102 protein-coding genes - 87% of which were 
      assigned a putative function. Comparative analyses revealed gene expansions of sigma 
      class GSTs and CYP3 P450s. Conversely the UGT gene family showed limited expansion. 
      Differences were seen in the distributions of resistance-associated gene families at 
      the subfamily level between O. laevigatus and some of its targeted crop pests. A 
      target site mutation in ryanodine receptors (I4790M, PxRyR) which has strong links 
      to diamide resistance in crop pests and had previously only been identified in 
      lepidopteran species was found to also be present in hemipteran species, including 
      O. laevigatus. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: This assembly is the first published 
      genome for the Anthocoridae family and will serve as a useful resource for further 
      research into target-site selectivity issues and potential resistance mechanisms in 
      beneficial predators. Furthermore, the expansion of gene families often linked to 
      insecticide resistance may be an indicator of the capacity of this predator to 
      detoxify selective insecticides. These findings could be exploited by targeted 
      pesticide screens and functional studies to increase effectiveness of IPM 
      strategies, which aim to increase crop yields by sustainably, 
      environmentally-friendly and effectively control pests without impacting beneficial 
      predator populations.

AB  - CDC45, which plays a role in eukaryotic DNA replication, is a member of the CMG 
      (CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS) complex that is thought to function as a replicative DNA 
      helicase. However, the biochemical properties of CDC45 are not fully understood. We 
      systematically examined the interactions of human CDC45 with MCM2-7, GINS and other 
      replication proteins by immunoprecipitation. We found that CDC45 can directly 
      interact with all MCM2-7 proteins; with PSF2, PSF3 and SLD5 in GINS subunits; and 
      with replication protein A2 (RPA2), AND-1 and topoisomerase 2-binding protein 1. 
      These results are consistent with the notion that CDC45 plays a role in progression 
      of DNA replication forks. Experiments using antibodies against CDC45 show that the 
      level of CDC45 recovered from the Triton-insoluble chromatin-containing fraction is 
      peaked at middle of S phase in synchronized HeLa cells. However, incubation of the 
      Triton-insoluble fraction with nucleases resulted in recovery of less than half the 
      amount of CDC45 in the nuclease-sensitive fraction; this result is in contrast with 
      RPA1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen distribution. These results indicate 
      that a considerable portion of CDC45 localizes in a region other than the DNA 
      replication forks in nuclei or it localizes on the replication forks but it is not 
      fractionated with the fork proteins owing to its tight association with presumably 
      nuclear scaffolds.

AB  - Understanding how insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis 
      (Bt) interact with their hosts is crucial to fully explain the molecular bases of Bt 
      specificity and insecticidal activity. Previous studies support ATP binding cassette 
      transporters (ABCC2/3) and one cadherin-like protein are Cry1Ac functional receptors 
      in the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua). In this study, a combined one-dimensional 
      gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting approach identified aminopeptidase N (APNs) 
      as putative Cry1Ac binding proteins in the midgut brush border membrane of S. exigua 
      larvae. Functional analyses by gene silencing of six different S. exigua APN genes 
      (SeAPN1, SeAPN2, SeAPN3, SeAPN4, SeAPN5 and SeAPN6) showed that only suppression of 
      SeAPN1 resulted in decreased larval susceptibility to Cry1Ac toxin. These results 
      support that SeAPN1 plays important functional role in Cry1Ac toxicity in S. exigua.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis produces Cry toxins, which are used as insecticides in sprays 
      and in transgenic crops. However, little is known about the function of Cry toxin 
      receptors and the mechanisms that determine their binding specificity and activity. 
      In this study, the cRNAs of Bombyx mori ABC transporter C2 (BmABCC2), the 
      toxin-binding region of cadherin-like receptor (BtR175-TBR), or aminopeptidase N1 
      (BmAPN1) were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and the Cry1Aa-dependent 
      cation-selective pore formation activities of these receptors were analyzed using a 
      two-electrode voltage clamp. Cation current passing through the pores was detected 
      within 25 s, and increased in a linear fashion in BmABCC2-expressing oocytes treated 
      with 88 nm Cry1Aa. This result suggested that Cry1Aa continuously made stable pores 
      with the help of BmABCC2. In contrast, no cation current was observed until 60 min 
      after incubation with 500 nm Cry1Aa in BtR175TBR-expressing oocytes even though 
      oligomerization of Cry1Aa progressed. This result indicated that in the presence of 
      BtR175-TBR most of the oligomerized toxin could not enter the cell membrane. 
      However, oocytes that simultaneously expressed both receptors demonstrated that 
      BtR175-TBR exerted a synergistic effect with BmABCC2 on pore formation in the 
      presence of 22 nm Cry1Aa. These results confirm that the main reason for 
      moderate-level resistance in insects lacking the cadherin-like receptor but 
      expressing ABCC2 is the absence of a similar synergistic promotion of toxin 
      oligomerization. Similar to results from our previous report evaluating ectopic 
      expression in the Sf9/Baculovirus system, BmAPN1 could not by itself cause 
      Cry1A-related pore formation, despite the fact that BmAPN1 gathered toxin on the 
      oocytes as well as BmABCC2 did.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) chemical protection depends upon discrete control of 
      small-molecule access by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Curiously, some drugs cause 
      CNS side-effects despite negligible transit past the BBB. To investigate this 
      phenomenon, we asked whether the highly BBB-enriched drug efflux transporter MDR1 
      has dual functions in controlling drug and endogenous molecule CNS homeostasis. If 
      this is true, then brain-impermeable drugs could induce behavioral changes by 
      affecting brain levels of endogenous molecules. Using computational, genetic, and 
      pharmacologic approaches across diverse organisms, we demonstrate that BBB-localized 
      efflux transporters are critical for regulating brain levels of endogenous steroids 
      and steroid-regulated behaviors (sleep in Drosophila and anxiety in mice). 
      Furthermore, we show that MDR1-interacting drugs are associated with anxiety-related 
      behaviors in humans. We propose a general mechanism for common behavioral side 
      effects of prescription drugs: pharmacologically challenging BBB efflux transporters 
      disrupts brain levels of endogenous substrates and implicates the BBB in behavioral 
      regulation.

TI  - Plasmodium vivax multidrug resistance-1 gene polymorphism in French Guiana.
PG  - 540
LID - 540
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax malaria is a major public health problem in French 
      Guiana. Some cases of resistance to chloroquine, the first-line treatment used 
      against P. vivax malaria, have been described in the Brazilian Amazon region. The 
      aim of this study is to investigate a possible dispersion of chloroquine-resistant 
      P. vivax isolates in French Guiana. The genotype, polymorphism and copy number 
      variation, of the P. vivax multidrug resistance gene-1 (pvmdr1) have been previously 
      associated with modification of the susceptibility to chloroquine. METHODS: The 
      pvmdr1 gene polymorphism was evaluated by sequencing and copy number variation was 
      assessed by real-time PCR, in P. vivax isolates obtained from 591 symptomatic 
      patients from 1997 to 2013. RESULTS: The results reveal that 1.0% [95% CI 0.4-2.2] 
      of French Guiana isolates carry the mutations Y976F and F1076L, and that the 
      proportion of isolates with multiple copies of pvmdr1 has significantly decreased 
      over time, from 71.3% (OR = 6.2 [95% CI 62.9-78.7], p < 0.0001) in 1997-2004 to 
      12.8% (OR = 0.03 [95% CI 9.4-16.9], p < 0.0001) in 2009-2013. A statistically 
      significant relationship was found between Guf-A (harboring the single mutation 
      T958M) and Sal-1 (wild type) alleles and pvmdr1 copy number. CONCLUSIONS: Few P. 
      vivax isolates harboring chloroquine-resistant mutations in the pvmdr1 gene are 
      circulating in French Guiana. However, the decrease in the prevalence of isolates 
      carrying multiple copies of pvmdr1 might indicate that the P. vivax population in 
      French Guiana is evolving towards a decreased susceptibility to chloroquine.

TI  - RNA interference validation of detoxification genes involved in ivermectin tolerance 
      in Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 651-660
LID - 10.1111/imb.12512 [doi]
AB  - Previously, we observed increased transcription levels of specific cytochrome P450 
      monooxygenase (P450) and adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
      genes in human body lice, Pediculus humanus humanus, following exposure to 
      ivermectin using the non-invasive induction assay, which resulted in tolerance. To 
      confirm the roles of these genes in induction and tolerance, the robust genetic 
      model insect Drosophila melanogaster was chosen. Orthologous genes corresponding to 
      the body louse P450 (Cyp9f2, Cyp6g2 and Cyp9h1) and ABC transporter (Mrp1, GC1824 as 
      an ABCB type and CG3327 as an ABCG type) genes were selected for in vivo bioassay. 
      Following a brief treatment with a sublethal dose of ivermectin, the mortality 
      response was significantly slower, indicating the presence of tolerance. 
      Concurrently, the transcription levels of Cyp9f2 and Mrp1 at 3 h and those of 
      Cyp6g2, Cyp9h1, Mrp1, CG1824 and CG3327 at 6 h post-treatment were upregulated, 
      indicating gene induction. In behavioural bioassay using GAL4/UAS-RNA interference 
      transgenic fly lines, increased susceptibility to ivermectin was observed following 
      heat shock in the Cyp9f2 , Cyp6g2 , Cyp9h1 , Mrp1 or CG3327-knockdown flies. 
      Considering that these five genes are orthologous to those which had the largest 
      over-expression level following ivermectin-induced tolerance in the body louse, the 
      current results suggest that they are also associated with ivermectin detoxification 
      in D. melanogaster and that body lice and D. melanogaster are likely to share, in 
      part, similar mechanisms of tolerance to ivermectin.

TI  - De novo transcriptome analysis of the excretory tubules of Carausius morosus 
      (Phasmatodea) and possible functions of the midgut 'appendices'.
PG  - e0174984
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0174984 [doi]
LID - e0174984
AB  - The Malpighian tubules are the insect excretory organs, responsible for ion and 
      water homeostasis and elimination of nitrogenous wastes. Post-genomic assays suggest 
      they also metabolize and detoxify xenobiotic compounds and have antimicrobial 
      properties. The Phasmatodea have an additional, unique set of excretory organs 
      referred to predominantly as midgut appendices. Their function and how it compares 
      to phasmid and other insect Malpighian tubules is unknown. Hypotheses include 
      carbonic anhydrase activity, calcium and metal cation sequestration, and xenobiotic 
      transport. This work presents the first comparative transcriptomic analysis of the 
      Phasmatodean excretory organs, using the model insect Carausius morosus. I produced 
      de novo transcriptomes of the midgut appendices, midgut wall, and Malpighian 
      tubules, and looked for differentially expressed genes associated with putative 
      organ functions. The appendices differentially and highly express lipid transport 
      and metabolism proteins, and the biomineralization gene otopetrin. The Malpighian 
      tubules differentially and highly express acid phosphatases and multiple transporter 
      types, while appendices express fat-soluble vitamin and peptide transporters. Many 
      defense proteins such as multidrug resistance proteins, ABC transporters, cytochrome 
      P450's, and glutathione-S-transferases were differentially expressed in specific 
      excretory organs. I hypothesize that the appendices and Malpighian tubules both have 
      defensive / xenobiotic metabolism functions, but each likely target different 
      substrates. Phasmid Malpighian tubules excrete as in other insects, while the 
      appendices may predominantly regulate amino acids, fats, and fat-soluble compounds. 
      Lipid metabolism in insects is poorly understood, and the Phasmatodea may thus serve 
      as a model for studying this further.

TI  - Influence of the yjiL-mdtM Gene Cluster on the Antibacterial Activity of 
      Proline-Rich Antimicrobial Peptides Overcoming Escherichia coli Resistance Induced 
      by the Missing SbmA Transporter System.
PG  - 5992-8
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01307-15 [doi]
AB  - In view of increasing health threats from multiresistant pathogens, antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) and, specifically, proline-rich AMPs (PrAMPs) have been investigated 
      in animal models. PrAMPs enter bacteria via the ABC transporter SbmA and inhibit 
      intracellular targets. We used phage transduction (Tn10 insertion) to screen by 
      random mutagenesis for alternative uptake mechanisms for analogs of apidaecin 1b, a 
      honeybee-derived PrAMP. All 24 apidaecin-resistant mutants had the Tn10 insertion in 
      the sbmA gene. These sbmA::Tn10 insertion mutants and the Escherichia coli BW25113 
      ΔsbmA (JW0368) strain were still susceptible to the bactenecin PrAMP Bac7(1-35) and 
      oncocin PrAMPs Onc18 and Onc112, as well as to Chex1-Arg20, despite significantly 
      reduced internalizations. In a second round of random mutagenesis, the remaining 
      susceptibility was linked to the yjiL-mdtM gene cluster. E. coli BW25113 and its 
      ΔyjiL null mutant (JW5785) were equally susceptible to all PrAMPs tested, whereas 
      the BW25113 ΔmdtM mutant was less susceptible to oncocins. The JW0368 yjiL::Tn10 
      transposon mutant (BS2) was resistant to all short PrAMPs and susceptible only to 
      full-length Bac7 and A3-APO. Interestingly, PrAMPs appear to enter bacteria via 
      MdtM, a multidrug resistance transporter (drug/H(+) antiporter) of the major 
      facilitator superfamily (MFS) that can efflux antibiotics, biocides, and bile salts. 
      In conclusion, PrAMPs enter bacteria via ABC and MFS transporters that efflux 
      antibiotics and cytotoxic compounds from the cytoplasm to the periplasm.

TI  - CRISPR-Mediated Knockout of the ABCC2 Gene in Ostrinia furnacalis Confers High-Level 
      Resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Fa Toxin.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12040246 [doi]
LID - 246
AB  - The adoption of transgenic crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal 
      crystalline (Cry) proteins has reduced insecticide application, increased yields, 
      and contributed to food safety worldwide. However, the efficacy of transgenic Bt 
      crops is put at risk by the adaptive resistance evolution of target pests. Previous 
      studies indicate that resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A and Cry1F toxins 
      was genetically linked with mutations of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
      subfamily C gene ABCC2 in at least seven lepidopteran insects. Several strains 
      selected in the laboratory of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, a 
      destructive pest of corn in Asian Western Pacific countries, developed high levels 
      of resistance to Cry1A and Cry1F toxins. The causality between the O. furnacalis 
      ABCC2 (OfABCC2) gene and resistance to Cry1A and Cry1F toxins remains unknown. Here, 
      we successfully generated a homozygous strain (OfC2-KO) of O. furnacalis with an 
      8-bp deletion mutation of ABCC2 by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. The 8-bp deletion 
      mutation results in a frame shift in the open reading frame of transcripts, which 
      produced a predicted protein truncated in the TM4-TM5 loop region. The knockout 
      strain OfC2-KO showed much more than a 300-fold resistance to Cry1Fa, and low levels 
      of resistance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac (<10-fold), but no significant effects on the 
      toxicities of Cry1Aa and two chemical insecticides (abamectin and 
      chlorantraniliprole), compared to the background NJ-S strain. Furthermore, we found 
      that the Cry1Fa resistance was autosomal, recessive, and significantly linked with 
      the 8-bp deletion mutation of OfABCC2 in the OfC2-KO strain. In conclusion, in vivo 
      functional investigation demonstrates the causality of the OfABCC2 truncating 
      mutation with high-level resistance to the Cry1Fa toxin in O. furnacalis. Our 
      results suggest that the OfABCC2 protein might be a functional receptor for Cry1Fa 
      and reinforces the association of this gene to the mode of action of the Cry1Fa 
      toxin.

TI  - Knockout of a P-glycoprotein gene increases susceptibility to abamectin and 
      emamectin benzoate in Spodoptera exigua.
PG  - 36-45
LID - 10.1111/imb.12338 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein [P-gp or the ATP-binding cassette transporter B1 (ABCB1)] is an 
      important participant in multidrug resistance of cancer cells, yet the precise 
      function of this arthropod transporter is unknown. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the importance of P-gp for susceptibility to insecticides in the beet 
      armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) gene-editing technology. We cloned an open 
      reading frame (ORF) encoding the S. exigua P-gp protein (SeP-gp) predicted to 
      display structural characteristics common to P-gp and other insect ABCB1 
      transporters. A knockout line with a frame shift deletion of four nucleotides in the 
      SeP-gp ORF was established using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system to test its 
      potential role in determining susceptibility to chemical insecticides or 
      insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Results from 
      comparative bioassays demonstrate that knockout of SeP-gp significantly increases 
      susceptibility of S. exigua by around threefold to abamectin and emamectin benzoate 
      (EB), but not to spinosad, chlorfenapyr, beta-cypermethrin, carbosulfan indoxacarb, 
      chlorpyrifos, phoxim, diafenthiuron, chlorfluazuron, chlorantraniliprole or two Bt 
      toxins (Cry1Ca and Cry1Fa). Our data support an important role for SeP-gp in 
      susceptibility of S. exigua to abamectin and EB and imply that overexpression of 
      SeP-gp may contribute to abamectin and EB resistance in S. exigua.

TI  - Hexahydroquinolines are antimalarial candidates with potent blood-stage and 
      transmission-blocking activity.
PG  - 1403-1414
LID - 10.1038/s41564-017-0007-4 [doi]
AB  - Antimalarial compounds with dual therapeutic and transmission-blocking activity are 
      desired as high-value partners for combination therapies. Here, we report the 
      identification and characterization of hexahydroquinolines (HHQs) that show low 
      nanomolar potency against both pathogenic and transmissible intra-erythrocytic forms 
      of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This activity translates into potent 
      transmission-blocking potential, as shown by in vitro male gamete formation assays 
      and reduced oocyst infection and prevalence in Anopheles mosquitoes. In vivo studies 
      illustrated the ability of lead HHQs to suppress Plasmodium berghei blood-stage 
      parasite proliferation. Resistance selection studies, confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9-based 
      gene editing, identified the digestive vacuole membrane-spanning transporter PfMDR1 
      (P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene-1) as a determinant of parasite resistance 
      to HHQs. Haemoglobin and haem fractionation assays suggest a mode of action that 
      results in reduced haemozoin levels and might involve inhibition of host haemoglobin 
      uptake into intra-erythrocytic parasites. Furthermore, parasites resistant to HHQs 
      displayed increased susceptibility to several first-line antimalarial drugs, 
      including lumefantrine, confirming that HHQs have a different mode of action to 
      other antimalarials drugs for which PfMDR1 is known to confer resistance. This work 
      evokes therapeutic strategies that combine opposing selective pressures on this 
      parasite transporter as an approach to countering the emergence and transmission of 
      multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria.

TI  - Isoproturon-Induced Salicylic Acid Confers Arabidopsis Resistance to Isoproturon 
      Phytotoxicity and Degradation in Plants.
PG  - 13073-13083
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b04281 [doi]
AB  - This study identified the effect of salicylic acid on degradation of isoproturon in 
      Arabidopsis. Three T-DNA insertion mutant lines pal1- 1, pal1- 2, and eps1- 1 
      defective in salicylic acid synthesis were tested, which showed higher isoproturon 
      accumulation and a toxic symptom in the mutants. When treated with 5 mg/L salicylic 
      acid, these lines displayed a lower level of isoproturon and showed an attenuated 
      toxic symptom. An RNA-sequencing study identified 2651 (1421 up and 1230 down) 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in eps1- 1 and 2211 (1556 up and 655 down) in 
      pal1- 2 mutant plants (>2.0 fold change, p < 0.05). Some of the DEGs covered Phase 
      I-III reaction components, like glycosyltransferases (GTs) and ATP-binding cassette 
      transporters (ABCs). Using ultra performance liquid 
      chromatography-time-of-flight-tandem-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer 
      (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS), 13 Phase I and four Phase II metabolites were characterized. Of 
      these, two metabolites 1-OH-isopropyl-benzene-O-glucoside and 
      4-isopropylphenol-S-2-methylbutanoyl-serine, have been identified and reported for 
      the first time.

AB  - The reuse of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) as an indoor residual spray was 
      permitted by the World Health Organization in 2007, and approximately 14 countries 
      still use DDT to control disease vectors. The extensive exposure of insects to DDT 
      has resulted in the emergence of DDT resistance, especially in mosquitoes, and the 
      mechanism for this resistance in mosquitoes has been widely reported. Spraying can 
      also introduce DDT directly into surface water, and DDT can subsequently accumulate 
      in microorganisms, but the mechanism for the resistance to DDT degradation in 
      microorganisms is unclear. Using whole-genome microarray analysis, we detected an 
      abcb15 gene that was up-regulated in a specific manner by DDT treatment in T. 
      thermophile. The deduced ABCB15 peptide sequence had two transmembrane domains 
      (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to form the structure 
      TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD, and each NBD contained three conserved motifs: Walker-A, C-loop, 
      and Walker-B, which indicated the T. thermophila abcb15 was a typical ABC 
      transporter gene. The expression of ABCB15 fused with a C-terminal green fluorescent 
      protein was found to be on the periphery of the cell, suggesting that ABCB15 was a 
      membrane pump protein. In addition, cells with abcb15 partially knocked down 
      (abcb15-KD) grew slower than wild-type cells in the presence of 256 mg L(-1) DDT, 
      indicating the tolerance of abcb15-KD strain to DDT exposure was decreased. Thus, we 
      suggest that in Tetrahymena, the membrane pump protein encoded by ABCT gene abcb15 
      can enhance the tolerance to DDT and protect cells from this exogenous toxin by 
      efficiently pumping it to the extracellular space.

TI  - Proteomic Analyses Reveal the Mechanism of Dunaliella salina Ds-26-16 Gene Enhancing 
      Salt Tolerance in Escherichia coli.
PG  - e0153640

LID - e0153640
AB  - We previously screened the novel gene Ds-26-16 from a 4 M salt-stressed Dunaliella 
      salina cDNA library and discovered that this gene conferred salt tolerance to 
      broad-spectrum organisms, including E. coli (Escherichia coli), Haematococcus 
      pluvialis and tobacco. To determine the mechanism of this gene conferring salt 
      tolerance, we studied the proteome of E. coli overexpressing the full-length cDNA of 
      Ds-26-16 using the iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) 
      approach. A total of 1,610 proteins were identified, which comprised 39.4% of the 
      whole proteome. Of the 559 differential proteins, 259 were up-regulated and 300 were 
      down-regulated. GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and 
      genomes) enrichment analyses identified 202 major proteins, including those involved 
      in amino acid and organic acid metabolism, energy metabolism, carbon metabolism, ROS 
      (reactive oxygen species) scavenging, membrane proteins and ABC (ATP binding 
      cassette) transporters, and peptidoglycan synthesis, as well as 5 up-regulated 
      transcription factors. Our iTRAQ data suggest that Ds-26-16 up-regulates the 
      transcription factors in E. coli to enhance salt resistance through osmotic balance, 
      energy metabolism, and oxidative stress protection. Changes in the proteome were 
      also observed in E. coli overexpressing the ORF (open reading frame) of Ds-26-16. 
      Furthermore, pH, nitric oxide and glycerol content analyses indicated that Ds-26-16 
      overexpression increases nitric oxide content but has no effect on glycerol content, 
      thus confirming that enhanced nitric oxide synthesis via lower intercellular pH was 
      one of the mechanisms by which Ds-26-16 confers salt tolerance to E. coli.

TI  - Effect of multiple cysteine substitutions on the functionality of human multidrug

PG  - 1403-13

AB  - Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is a broad-specificity membrane transporter 
      belonging to the C branch of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. MRP1 
      confers resistance to various chemotherapeutic drugs and transports a wide range of 
      conjugated organic anions. Several ABCC proteins, including MRP1, are unusual among 
      ABC transporters in having a third membrane-spanning domain (MSD), MSD0, at their N 
      termini. MRP1 lacking this additional MSD (ΔMRP1) is able to traffic to the plasma 
      membrane of mammalian cells and to transport a number of well characterized 
      substrates. A cysteineless (cysless) ΔMRP1 has been expressed in yeast and reported 
      to be functional. However, we found that trafficking of such a construct in human 
      cells was severely compromised, and, even when expressed in insect Sf21 cells, the 
      protein had extremely low transport activity. Therefore, we have systematically 
      examined the effects of substituting cysteines in the four domains of ΔMRP1, 
      initially with alanine. These studies allowed us to identify five cysteines that 
      cannot be replaced with alanine without inactivating the protein. Substitution of 
      two of these residues with alternative amino acids has allowed us to produce an 
      almost cysless form of ΔMRP1 that traffics to the plasma membrane and transports 
      leukotriene C(4), 17β-estradiol 17-β-D-glucuronide, and estrone-3-sulfate with 
      kinetic characteristics similar to those of the wild-type protein. The distribution 
      of the remaining Cys residues is such that the protein will provide a useful 
      template for a variety of cysteine based mutagenesis studies.

AB  - Drosophila suzukii (commonly called spotted wing Drosophila) is an invasive pest of 
      soft-skinned fruit (e.g. blueberries, strawberries). A high quality reference genome 
      sequence is available but functional genomic tools, such as used in Drosophila 
      melanogaster, remain to be developed. In this study we have used the CRISPR/Cas9 
      system to introduce site-specific mutations in the D. suzukii white (w) and Sex 
      lethal (Sxl) genes. Hemizygous males with w mutations develop white eyes and the 
      mutant genes are transmissible to the next generation. Somatic mosaic females that 
      carry mutations in the Sxl gene develop abnormal genitalia and reproductive tissue. 
      The D. suzukii Sxl gene could be an excellent target for a Cas9-mediated gene drive 
      to suppress populations of this highly destructive pest.

AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster white-eyed w(1118) line serves as a parental stock, 
      allowing genetic recombination of any gene of interest along with a readily 
      recognizable marker. w(1118) flies display behavioral susceptibility to 
      environmental stimulation such as light. It is of great importance to characterize 
      the behavioral performance of w(1118) flies because this would provide a baseline 
      from which the effect of the gene of interest could be differentiated. Little work 
      has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w(1118) flies. Here 
      we show that pulsed light stimulation increased the regularity of walking 
      trajectories of w(1118) flies in circular arenas. We statistically modeled the 
      distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w(1118) 
      flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual 
      walking structures. Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of 
      crossing over the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of 
      mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed light 
      stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect of 
      mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic light 
      stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w(1118) flies and an 
      unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying w(1118) 
      isogenic background.

AB  - The ABCG2 membrane protein is a key xeno- and endobiotic transporter, modulating the 
      absorption and metabolism of pharmacological agents and causing multidrug resistance 
      in cancer. ABCG2 is also involved in uric acid elimination and its impaired function 
      is causative in gout. Analysis of ABCG2 expression in the erythrocyte membranes of 
      healthy volunteers and gout patients showed an enrichment of lower expression levels 
      in the patients. By genetic screening based on protein expression, we found a 
      relatively frequent, novel ABCG2 mutation (ABCG2-M71V), which, according to cellular 
      expression studies, causes reduced protein expression, although with preserved 
      transporter capability. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated a stumbled dynamics 
      of the mutant protein, while ABCG2-M71V expression in vitro could be corrected by 
      therapeutically relevant small molecules. These results suggest that personalized 
      medicine should consider this newly discovered ABCG2 mutation, and genetic analysis 
      linked to protein expression provides a new tool to uncover clinically important 
      mutations in membrane proteins.

TI  - Detoxification of ivermectin by ATP binding cassette transporter C4 and cytochrome 
      P450 monooxygenase 6CJ1 in the human body louse, Pediculus humanus humanus.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1111/imb.12348 [doi]
AB  - We previously observed that ivermectin-induced detoxification genes, including ATP 
      binding cassette transporter C4 (PhABCC4) and cytochrome P450 6CJ1 (CYP6CJ1) were 
      identified from body lice following a brief exposure to a sublethal dose of 
      ivermectin using a non-invasive induction assay. In this current study, the 
      functional properties of PhABCC4 and CYP6CJ1 were investigated after expression in 
      either X. laevis oocytes or using a baculovirus expression system, respectively. 
      Efflux of [(3) H]-9-(2-phosphonomethoxyethyl) adenine ([(3) H]-PMEA), a known ABCC4 
      substrate in humans, was detected from PhABCC4 cRNA-injected oocytes by liquid 
      scintillation spectrophotometric analysis and PhABCC4 expression in oocytes was 
      confirmed using ABC transporter inhibitors. Efflux was also determined to be 
      ATP-dependent. Using a variety of insecticides in a competition assay, only 
      co-injection of ivermectin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane led to decreased 
      efflux of [(3) H]-PMEA. PhABCC4-expressing oocytes also directly effluxed [(3) 
      H]-ivermectin, which increased over time. In addition, ivermectin appeared to be 
      oxidatively metabolized and/or sequestered, although at low levels, following 
      functional expression of CYP6CJ1 along with cytochrome P450 reductase in Sf9 cells. 
      Our study suggests that PhABCC4 and perhaps CYP6CJ1 are involved in the Phase III 
      and Phase I xenobiotic metabolism of ivermectin, respectively, and may play an 
      important role in the evolution of ivermectin resistance in lice and other insects 
      as field selection occurs.

TI  - ATP-Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 2 is a Functional Receptor for Bacillus 
      thuringiensis Cry2A Toxins in Bombyx mori, but not for Cry1A, Cry1C, Cry1D, Cry1F, 
      or Cry9A Toxins.

AB  - : Cry toxins are insecticidal proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). They 
      are used commercially to control insect pests since they are very active in specific 
      insects and are harmless to the environment and human health. The gene encoding 
      ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 2 (ABCA2) was identified in an analysis of 
      Cry2A toxin resistance genes. However, we do not have direct evidence for the role 
      of ABCA2 for Cry2A toxins or why Cry2A toxin resistance does not cross to other Cry 
      toxins. Therefore, we performed two experiments. First, we edited the ABCA2 sequence 
      in Bombyx mori using transcription activator-like effector-nucleases (TALENs) and 
      confirmed the susceptibility-determining ability in a diet overlay bioassay. Strains 
      with C-terminal half-deleted BmABCA2 showed strong and specific resistance to Cry2A 
      toxins; even strains carrying a deletion of 1 to 3 amino acids showed resistance. 
      However, the C-terminal half-deleted strains did not show cross-resistance to other 
      toxins. Second, we conducted a cell swelling assay and confirmed the specific 
      ability of BmABCA2 to Cry2A toxins in HEK239 cells. Those demonstrated that BmABCA2 
      is a functional receptor for Cry2A toxins and that BmABCA2 deficiency-dependent 
      Cry2A resistance does not confer cross-resistance to Cry1A, Cry1F, Cry1Ca, Cry1Da, 
      or Cry9Aa toxins.

TI  - Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Is a New Substrate of ATP-Binding Cassette Subfamily C 
      Member 11.
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01725-16 [doi]
LID - e01725-16
AB  - Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 
      after conversion to tenofovir (TFV), is mainly eliminated by glomerular filtration 
      and active tubular secretion. The major adverse effect of tenofovir is 
      nephrotoxicity; however, the exact mechanism remains poorly understood. In this 
      study, the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 11 (ABCC11; multidrug resistance 
      protein 8 [MRP8]) transporter, which is abundant in proximal tubular cells, was 
      demonstrated to act as an efflux transporter of tenofovir. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) 
      and indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to determine MRP8 overexpression in 
      a continuous cell line. Tenofovir accumulations were assessed by cytotoxicity, 
      cellular transport, and vesicular uptake assays. Substrate specificity was confirmed 
      using MK-571, an MRP-specific inhibitor, and methotrexate, which served as a known 
      substrate. Intracellular and intravesicular concentrations of tenofovir were 
      determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The 50% 
      cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) of TDF in MRP8-overexpressing cells was 4.78 times 
      higher than that of parental cells. Transport assays also showed that the 
      intracellular accumulation of tenofovir in MRP8-overexpressing cells was 55 times 
      lower than that in parental cells and was partly reversed by MK-571. Similarly, an 
      "inside-out" vesicular uptake assay, using Sf9 inverted membrane vesicles to allow 
      measuring of accumulation of the substrates into the vesicles, demonstrated a higher 
      intravesicular concentration of tenofovir in MRP8-overexpressing vesicles than in 
      Sf9 insect control vesicles. These effects were effectively reversed by increasing 
      concentrations of the specific inhibitor MK-571. In conclusion, tenofovir is a new 
      substrate of the MRP8 transporter. An alteration in the activity of this efflux pump 
      may increase the intracellular accumulation of tenofovir in proximal renal tubular 
      cells.

      member 13 (ABCA13) have been recently identified in a monkey that displays behavior 
      associated with ASD. ABCA13, a member of the ABCA family of proteins, is predicted 
      to transport lipid molecules and is expressed in the human trachea, testis, bone 
      marrow, hippocampus, cortex, and other tissues. However, its physiological function 
      remains unknown. Drosophila CG1718 shows high homology to human ABCA genes including 
      ABCA13 and is thus designated as Drosophila ABCA (dABCA). To elucidate the 
      physiological role of dABCA, we specifically knocked down dABCA in all neurons of 
      flies and investigated their phenotypes. The pan-neuron-specific knockdown of dABCA 
      resulted in increased social space with the closest neighbor in adult male flies but 
      exerted no effect on their climbing ability, indicating that the increase in social 
      space is not due to a defect in their climbing ability. An activity assay with adult 
      male flies revealed that knockdown of dABCA in all neurons induces early onset of 
      evening activity in adult flies followed by relatively high activity during morning 
      peaks, evening peaks, and midday siesta. These phenotypes are similar to defects 
      observed in human ASD patients, suggesting that the established dABCA knockdown 
      flies are a promising model for ASD. In addition, an increase in satellite boutons 
      in presynaptic terminals of motor neurons was observed in dABCA knockdown third 
      instar larvae, suggesting that dABCA regulates the formation and/or maintenance of 
      presynaptic terminals of motor neurons.

AB  - TAP1/TAP2 complexes translocate peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic 
      reticulum lumen to enable immune surveillance by CD8(+) T cells. Peptide transport 
      is preceded by peptide binding to a cytosol-accessible surface of TAP1/TAP2 
      complexes, but the location of the TAP peptide-binding pocket remains unknown. 
      Guided by the known contributions of polymorphic TAP variants to peptide selection, 
      we combined homology modeling of TAP with experimental measurements to identify 
      several TAP residues that interact with peptides. Models for peptide-TAP complexes 
      were generated, which indicate bent conformation for peptides. The peptide binding 
      site of TAP is located at the hydrophobic boundary of the cytosolic membrane 
      leaflet, with striking parallels to the glutathione binding site of NaAtm1, a 
      transporter that functions in bacterial heavy metal detoxification. These studies 
      illustrate the conservation of the ligand recognition modes of bacterial and 
      mammalians transporters involved in peptide-guided cellular surveillance.

AB  - Previous study revealed that the MRP1 gene ortholog DMRP1/CG6214 of Drosophila 
      melanogaster contains 12 exons in the coding region. In the current study, the genes 
      of DMRP1/CG6214 from D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis were compared, and the 
      result indicated that D. virilis had an extra intron located in exon 2, implying 
      that intron loss or gain might have occurred at this locus. To track the evolution 
      of the extra intron (Intron Z), orthologous nucleotide sequences of 37 arthropod 
      species were cloned or annotated. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we found that 
      Intron Z should present in the common ancestor of arthropod species, more than 420 
      Ma. In addition, we found that Sophophora subgenus species and mosquito (Culex 
      pipiens) lost Intron Z independently, showing evolutionary convergence.

AB  - ABCC2 is a transporter with key influence on liver and kidney pharmacokinetics. In 
      order to explore the structure-activity relationships of compounds that modulate 
      ABCC2, and by doing so gain insights into drug-drug interactions, we screened a 
      library of 432 compounds for modulators of radiolabeled β-estradiol 
      17-(β-d-glucuronide) (EG) and fluorescent 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein 
      transport (CDCF) in membrane vesicles. Following the primary screen at 80μM, 
      dose-response curves were used to investigate in detail 86 compounds, identifying 16 
      low μM inhibitors and providing data about the structure-activity relationships in 
      four series containing 19, 24, 10, and eight analogues. Measurements with the CDCF 
      probe were consistently more robust than for the EG probe. Only one compound was 
      clearly probe-selective with a 50-fold difference in the IC50s obtained by the two 
      assays. We built 24 classification models using the SVM and fused-XY Kohonen 
      methods, revealing molecular descriptors related to number of rings, solubility and 
      lipophilicity as important to distinguish inhibitors from inactive compounds. This 
      study is to the best of our knowledge the first to provide details about 
      structure-activity relationships in ABCC2 modulation.

AB  - High levels of resistance to Bt toxin Cry2Ab have been identified to be genetically 
      linked with loss of function mutations of an ABC transporter gene (ABCA2) in two 
      lepidopteran insects, Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa punctigera. To further 
      confirm the causal relationship between the ABCA2 gene (HaABCA2) and Cry2Ab 
      resistance in H. armigera, two HaABCA2 knockout strains were created from the 
      susceptible SCD strain with the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. One strain 
      (SCD-A2KO1) is homozygous for a 2-bp deletion in exon 2 of HaABCA2 created by 
      non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The other strain (SCD-A2KO2) is homozygous for a 
      5-bp deletion in exon 18 of HaABCA2 made by homology-directed repair (HDR), which 
      was produced to mimic the r2 resistance allele of a field-derived Cry2Ab-resistant 
      strain from Australia. Both knockout strains obtained high levels of resistance to 
      both Cry2Aa (>120-fold) and Cry2Ab (>100-fold) compared with the original SCD 
      strain, but no or very limited resistance to Cry1Ac (<4-fold). Resistance to Cry2Ab 
      in both knockouts is recessive, and genetic complementary tests confirmed Cry2Ab 
      resistance alleles are at the same locus (i.e. HaABCA2) for the two strains. Brush 
      border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of midguts from both knockout strains lost binding 
      with Cry2Ab, but maintained the same binding with Cry1Ac as the SCD strain. In vivo 
      functional evidence from this study demonstrates knockout of HaABCA2 confers high 
      levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab, confirming that HaABCA2 plays a key 
      role in mediating toxicity of both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab against H. armigera.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders are caused by expanded CAG (Glutamine) 
      repeats in neurons in the brain. The expanded repeats are also expressed in the 
      non-neuronal cells, however, their contribution to disease pathogenesis is not very 
      well studied. In the present study, we have expressed a stretch of 127 Glutamine 
      repeats in Malpighian tubules (MTs) of Drosophila melanogaster as these tissues do 
      not undergo ecdysone induced histolysis during larval to pupal transition at 
      metamorphosis. RESULTS: Progressive degeneration, which is the hallmark of 
      neurodegeneration is also observed in MTs. The mutant protein forms inclusion bodies 
      in the nucleus resulting in expansion of the nucleus and affect chromatin 
      organization which appear loose and open, eventually resulting in DNA fragmentation 
      and blebbing. A virtual absence of tubule lumen was observed followed by functional 
      abnormalities. As development progressed, severe abnormalities affecting pupal 
      epithelial morphogenesis processes were observed resulting in complete lethality. 
      Distribution of heterogeneous RNA binding protein (hnRNP), HRB87F, Wnt/wingless and 
      JNK signaling and expression of Relish was also found to be affected. Expression of 
      resistance genes following polyQ expression was up regulated. CONCLUSION: The 
      present study gives an insight into the effects of polyQ aggregates in non-neuronal 
      tissues.

AB  - Plant essential oils with high bioactivity provide environmental friendly 
      alternatives for synthetic pesticides. Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil and its 
      main constituent terpinen-4-ol have high insecticidal activity to Sitophilus zeamais 
      Motschulsky. Terpinen-4-ol may be metabolized by human and insect cytochrome P450s. 
      However, little is known about how insects systemically respond to terpinen-4-ol. In 
      this study, we used an RNA-seq approach to evaluate the global gene expression of S. 
      zeamais after terpinen-4-ol fumigation. Duplicates of fumigated and control groups, 
      for a total of four libraries, were collected for sequencing. A total of 36,117 
      unigenes with an average length of 1036 bp were generated in the de novo assembled 
      transcriptome. Comparative analysis of S. zeamais libraries identified 592 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 308 and 284 genes were up- and 
      down-regulated in response to terpinen-4-ol fumigation, respectively. GO and KEGG 
      functional analyses were performed for up and downregulated DEGs separately, showing 
      these DEGs were enriched for terms related to catalytic activity, carbohydrate 
      metabolism, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. DEGs encoding enzymes for 
      detoxification were detected, including sixteen cytochrome P450s (P450s), eight 
      glutathione S-transferase (GSTs), fourteen esterase (ESTs), ten 
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs), and two ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC 
      transporter) genes. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that ten P450s, three GSTs 
      and one EST were up-regulated dramatically after exposure to terpinen-4-ol at 
      different concentrations and over a time course. The results provided a 
      transcriptional overview of the changes in a stored-grain pest in response to 
      terpinen-4-ol fumigation. The analysis revealed the expression levels of 
      detoxification genes were altered, especially for P450s, and provided candidate 
      genes for understanding systemic metabolic responses to terpinen-4-ol in insects.

TI  - Transmembrane Domain Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Impair Expression and Transport 
      Activity of ABC Transporter ABCG2.
PG  - 1626-1636
LID - 10.1007/s11095-017-2127-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the function and expression of nine naturally occurring 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (G406R, F431L, S441N, P480L, F489L, M515R, L525R, 
      A528T and T542A) that are predicted to reside in the transmembrane regions of the 
      ABC transporter ABCG2. METHODS: The transport activity of the variants was tested in 
      inside-out membrane vesicles from Sf9 insect and human derived HEK293 cells 
      overexpressing ABCG2. Lucifer Yellow and estrone sulfate were used as probe 
      substrates of activity. The expression levels and cellular localization of the 
      variants was compared to the wild-type ABCG2 by western blotting and 
      immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: All studied variants of ABCG2 displayed 
      markedly decreased transport in both Sf9-ABCG2 and HEK293-ABCG2 vesicles. Impaired 
      transport could be explained for some variants by altered expression levels and 
      cellular localization. Moreover, the destructive effect on transport activity of 
      variants G406R, P480L, M515R and T542A is, to our knowledge, reported for the first 
      time. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the transmembrane region of ABCG2 is 
      sensitive to amino acid substitution and that patients harboring these ABCG2 variant 
      forms could suffer from unexpected pharmacokinetic events of ABCG2 substrate drugs 
      or have an increased risk for diseases such as gout where ABCG2 is implicated.

AB  - Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used to control insect pests 
      either as formulated sprays or as in Bt-crops. However, field-evolved resistance to 
      Bt proteins is threatening the long-term use of Bt products. The SeABCC2 locus has 
      been genetically linked to resistance to a Bt bioinsecticide (Xentari™) in 
      Spodoptera exigua (a mutation producing a truncated form of the transporter lacking 
      an ATP binding domain was found in the resistant insects). Here, we investigated the 
      role of SeABCC2 in the mode of action of Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ca, and two 
      Cry1A-1Ca hybrids by expressing the receptor in Sf21 and HEK293T cell lines. Cell 
      toxicity assays showed that Sf21 cells expressing SeABCC2 become susceptible to 
      Cry1A proteins. HEK293T cells expressing the transporter were found susceptible to 
      Cry1A proteins but not to Cry1Ca. The results with the Cry1A-1Ca hybrids suggest 
      that domain II from Cry1Ab/c is crucial for the toxicity to Sf21 cells, whereas 
      domain III from Cry1Aa/b is crucial for the toxicity to HEK293T cells. Binding 
      assays showed that the Cry1Ac binding is of high affinity and specific to cells 
      expressing the SeABCC2 transporter. Heterologous competition experiments support a 
      model in which domain II of Cry1Ab/c has a common binding site in the SeABCC2 
      protein, whereas domain III of Cry1Aa/b binds to a different binding site in the 
      SeABCC2 protein.

AB  - Afferent neurons commonly exhibit a somatotopic arrangement in the central nervous 
      system that organizes spatially discrete sensory input. We are interested in how 
      that spatial input gets integrated into motor commands. With resources for screening 
      genes and neural circuits, and given that the cells and ion channels that transduce 
      tactile stimuli in Drosophila larvae are remarkably well-characterized, larval 
      mechanosensation is an ideal system for investigating how specific behaviors emerge 
      from localized sensory input. We observed that crawling larvae are more reactive to 
      a 20mN tactile stimulus on the head than on the tail or abdomen. Behavioral 
      responses that were evoked by the stimuli also depended on where the stimulus was 
      delivered. Differences in relative sensitivity were observed in different genotypes, 
      e.g., a null white mutant and hypomorphic smn mutant are significantly more reactive 
      to tail touches than Canton-S larvae. Responses were inhibited by silencing chemical 
      transmission in a combination of multidendritic and chordotonal neurons, but not by 
      inhibiting any specific subset of neurons. Extracellular recordings from segmental 
      nerves revealed that sensory-evoked responses exhibit spike-timing dependence at the 
      neural circuit level. Tactile stimuli reduced endogenous firing frequency and 
      increased bursting periods when applied during periods of motor activity. The same 
      stimulus initiated bursts of activity when applied during inactive periods. 
      Together, these data depict the spatial and temporal complexity of mechanosensation 
      as it applies to action selection, and provide a foundation for addressing how 
      neural circuits in the CNS adjust their activity to afferent input.

TI  - Resistance to DDT in an urban setting: common mechanisms implicated in both M and S 
      forms of Anopheles gambiae in the city of Yaoundé Cameroon.
PG  - e61408
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0061408 [doi]
LID - e61408
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the city of Yaoundé in Cameroon malaria is predominately transmitted 
      by the M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae and both are resistant to the 
      pyrethroid insecticides and DDT. Mutations in the target site of these insecticides, 
      present at a high frequency in malaria vectors in this city, contribute to this 
      resistance profile. To identify additional resistance mechanisms, the expression 
      profile of multiple DDT-resistant field populations of M and S molecular forms was 
      compared to laboratory-susceptible populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 
      prevalence of DDT resistance was highest in the S form population originating from 
      the cultivated site of Nkolondom (mortality after WHO bioassay = 4%). A high 
      prevalence of DDT resistance was also found in two urban M form populations, Messa 
      from a pristine unpolluted environment (DDT mortality = 54%), and Gare, where the 
      breeding sites are heavily polluted with organic matter (DDT mortality = 38%). 
      Microarray analysis showed that several transcripts coding for detoxification 
      enzymes (P450s, GSTs and UDPGTs) and ABC transporters were upregulated in the three 
      populations. Despite the presence of multiple detoxification genes over expressed in 
      the DDT-resistant subset of these field populations, only three were commonly over 
      expressed in resistant populations from all three environments. Two of these genes, 
      CYP6M2 and GSTD1-6, encode enzymes that have been previously shown to metabolize 
      DDT. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Analogous to target site resistance, genes involved in 
      metabolic resistance to DDT are also shared between the M and S forms of An gambiae. 
      Alternative explanations for this occurrence are explored.

TI  - Effects of a detergent micelle environment on P-glycoprotein (ABCB1)-ligand 
      interactions.
PG  - 7066-7076
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M116.771634 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a multidrug transporter that uses energy from ATP 
      hydrolysis to export many structurally dissimilar hydrophobic and amphipathic 
      compounds, including anticancer drugs from cells. Several structural studies on 
      purified P-gp have been reported, but only limited and sometimes conflicting 
      information is available on ligand interactions with the isolated transporter in a 
      dodecyl-maltoside detergent environment. In this report we compared the biochemical 
      properties of P-gp in native membranes, detergent micelles, and when reconstituted 
      in artificial membranes. We found that the modulators zosuquidar, tariquidar, and 
      elacridar stimulated the ATPase activity of purified human or mouse P-gp in a 
      detergent micelle environment. In contrast, these drugs inhibited ATPase activity in 
      native membranes or in proteoliposomes, with IC(50) values in the 10-40 nm range. 
      Similarly, a 30-150-fold decrease in the apparent affinity for verapamil and cyclic 
      peptide inhibitor QZ59-SSS was observed in detergent micelles compared with native 
      or artificial membranes. Together, these findings demonstrate that the high-affinity 
      site is inaccessible because of either a conformational change or binding of 
      detergent at the binding site in a detergent micelle environment. The ligands bind 
      to a low-affinity site, resulting in altered modulation of P-gp ATPase activity. We, 
      therefore, recommend studying structural and functional aspects of ligand 
      interactions with purified P-gp and other ATP-binding cassette transporters that 
      transport amphipathic or hydrophobic substrates in a detergent-free native or 
      artificial membrane environment.

AB  - Despite the growing evidence suggesting that pesticides contribute to chronic 
      diseases, there is a limited understanding of how these chemicals are removed from 
      cells and whether pesticides can alter the disposition of drugs. The present study 
      examined the effects of two classes of insecticides (organochlorine and pyrethroid) 
      on the ATPase activity of the human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and breast 
      cancer resistance protein (BCRP) efflux transporters. Using plasma membranes from 
      cells overexpressing MDR1 and BCRP, it was demonstrated that the organochlorine 
      pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT isomers) as 
      well as its metabolite (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane), inhibit both MDR1 and 
      BCRP ATPase activity. In addition, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, and two 
      pyrethroid pesticides inhibited BCRP ATPase activity between 4 and 7 μM. Additional 
      research is necessary to further characterize the functional inhibition of MDR1 and 
      BCRP activity and determine whether pesticides alter the transporter-mediated 
      disposition of other chemicals.

TI  - Resistance mutation conserved between insects and mites unravels the benzoylurea 
      insecticide mode of action on chitin biosynthesis.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1618258113 [doi]
AB  - Despite the major role of chitin biosynthesis inhibitors such as benzoylureas (BPUs) 
      in the control of pests in agricultural and public health for almost four decades, 
      their molecular mode of action (MoA) has in most cases remained elusive. BPUs 
      interfere with chitin biosynthesis and were thought to interact with sulfonylurea 
      receptors that mediate chitin vesicle transport. Here, we uncover a mutation 
      (I1042M) in the chitin synthase 1 (CHS1) gene of BPU-resistant Plutella xylostella 
      at the same position as the I1017F mutation reported in spider mites that confers 
      etoxazole resistance. Using a genome-editing CRISPR/Cas9 approach coupled with 
      homology-directed repair (HDR) in Drosophila melanogaster, we introduced both 
      substitutions (I1056M/F) in the corresponding fly CHS1 gene (kkv). Homozygous lines 
      bearing either of these mutations were highly resistant to etoxazole and all tested 
      BPUs, as well as buprofezin-an important hemipteran chitin biosynthesis inhibitor. 
      This provides compelling evidence that BPUs, etoxazole, and buprofezin share in fact 
      the same molecular MoA and directly interact with CHS. This finding has immediate 
      effects on resistance management strategies of major agricultural pests but also on 
      mosquito vectors of serious human diseases such as Dengue and Zika, as 
      diflubenzuron, the standard BPU, is one of the few effective larvicides in use. The 
      study elaborates on how genome editing can directly, rapidly, and convincingly 
      elucidate the MoA of bioactive molecules, especially when target sites are complex 
      and hard to reconstitute in vitro.

TI  - Association genetics of oleoresin flow in loblolly pine: discovering genes and

PG  - 89-100
LID - 10.1111/nph.12240 [doi]
AB  - Rapidly enhancing oleoresin production in conifer stems through genomic selection 
      and genetic engineering may increase resistance to bark beetles and terpenoid yield 
      for liquid biofuels. We integrated association genetic and genomic prediction 
      analyses of oleoresin flow (g 24 h(-1)) using 4854 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) in expressed genes within a pedigreed population of loblolly pine (Pinus 
      taeda) that was clonally replicated at three sites in the southeastern United 
      States. Additive genetic variation in oleoresin flow (h(2) ≈ 0.12-0.30) was strongly 
      correlated between years in which precipitation varied (r(a) ≈ 0.95), while the 
      genetic correlation between sites declined from 0.8 to 0.37 with increasing 
      differences in soil and climate among sites. A total of 231 SNPs were significantly 
      associated with oleoresin flow, of which 81% were specific to individual sites. SNPs 
      in sequences similar to ethylene signaling proteins, ABC transporters, and 
      diterpenoid hydroxylases were associated with oleoresin flow across sites. Despite 
      this complex genetic architecture, we developed a genomic prediction model to 
      accelerate breeding for enhanced oleoresin flow that is robust to environmental 
      variation. Results imply that breeding could increase oleoresin flow 1.5- to 
      2.4-fold in one generation.

TI  - White - cGMP Interaction Promotes Fast Locomotor Recovery from Anoxia in Adult

PG  - e0168361

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that the white (w) gene in Drosophila possesses 
      extra-retinal functions in addition to its classical role in eye pigmentation. We 
      have previously shown that w+ promotes fast and consistent locomotor recovery from 
      anoxia, but how w+ modulates locomotor recovery is largely unknown. Here we show 
      that in the absence of w+, several PDE mutants, especially cyclic guanosine 
      monophosphate (cGMP)-specific PDE mutants, display wildtype-like fast locomotor 
      recovery from anoxia, and that during the night time, locomotor recovery was 
      light-sensitive in white-eyed mutant w1118, and light-insensitive in PDE mutants 
      under w1118 background. Data indicate the involvement of cGMP in the modulation of 
      recovery timing and presumably, light-evoked cGMP fluctuation is associated with 
      light sensitivity of locomotor recovery. This was further supported by the 
      observations that w-RNAi-induced delay of locomotor recovery was completely 
      eliminated by upregulation of cGMP through multiple approaches, including PDE 
      mutation, simultaneous overexpression of an atypical soluble guanylyl cyclase 
      Gyc88E, or sildenafil feeding. Lastly, prolonged sildenafil feeding promoted fast 
      locomotor recovery from anoxia in w1118. Taken together, these data suggest that a 
      White-cGMP interaction modulates the timing of locomotor recovery from anoxia.

LID - e77904
AB  - Since its discovery by Morgan, the Drosophila white gene has become one of the most 
      intensely studied genes and has been widely used as a genetic marker. Earlier 
      reports that over- and misexpression of White protein in Drosophila males leads to 
      male-male courtship implicated white in courtship control. While previous studies 
      suggested that it is the mislocalization of White protein within cells that causes 
      the courtship phenotype, we demonstrate here that also the lack of extra-retinal 
      White can cause very similar behavioral changes. Moreover, we provide evidence that 
      the lack of White function increases the sexual arousal of males in general, of 
      which the enhanced male-male courtship might be an indirect effect. We further show 
      that white mutant flies are not only optomotor blind but also dazzled by the 
      over-flow of light in daylight. Implications of these findings for the proper 
      interpretation of behavioral studies with white mutant flies are discussed.

AB  - The ATP Binding Cassette transporter ABCB1 can export the neurotoxic peptide 
      β-amyloid from endothelial cells that line the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This has 
      the potential to lower cerebral levels of β-amyloid, but ABCB1 expression in the BBB 
      appears to be progressively reduced in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The 
      surface density of many membrane proteins is regulated by ubiquitination catalyzed 
      by ubiquitin E3 ligases. In brain capillaries of mice challenged with β-amyloid ex 
      vivo, we show that the level of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 increases concomitant 
      with reduction in Abcb1. In vitro we show that human ABCB1 is a substrate for human 
      NEDD4-1 ligase. Recombinant ABCB1 was purified from Sf21 insect cells and incubated 
      with recombinant NEDD4-1 purified from Escherichia coli. The treated ABCB1 had 
      reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry identified eight lysine 
      residues, K271, K272, K575, K685, K877, K885, K887 and K1062 that were ubiquitinated 
      by NEDD4-1. Molecular modelling showed that all of the residues are exposed on the 
      surface of the intracellular domains of ABCB1. K877, K885 and K887 in particular, 
      are located in the intracellular loop of transmembrane helix 10 (TMH10) in close 
      proximity, in the tertiary fold, to a putative NEDD4-1 binding site in the 
      intracellular helix extending from TMH12 (PxY motif, residues 996-998). Transient 
      expression of NEDD4-1 in HEK293 Flp-In cells stably expressing ABCB1 was shown to 
      reduce the surface density of the transporter. Together, the data identify this 
      ubiquitin ligase as a potential target for intervention in the pathophysiology of 
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Rapid evolution of resistance by insect pests severely jeopardizes the sustainable 
      utilization of biopesticides and transgenic crops that produce insecticidal crystal 
      proteins derived from the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). 
      Recently, high levels of resistance to Bt Cry1 toxins have been reported to be 
      genetically linked to the mutation or down-regulation of ABC transporter subfamily C 
      genes ABCC2 and ABCC3 in seven lepidopteran insects, including Plutella xylostella 
      (L.). To further determine the causal relationship between alterations in the 
      PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes and Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella, the novel 
      CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system was utilized to successfully construct two 
      knockout strains: the ABCC2KO strain is homozygous for a 4-bp deletion in exon 3 of 
      the PxABCC2 gene, and the ABCC3KO strain is homozygous for a 5-bp deletion in exon 3 
      of the PxABCC3 gene, both of which can produce only truncated ABCC proteins. 
      Bioassay results indicated that high levels of resistance to the Cry1Ac protoxin 
      were observed in both the ABCC2KO (724-fold) and ABCC3KO (413-fold) strains compared 
      to the original susceptible DBM1Ac-S strain. Subsequently, dominance degree and 
      genetic complementation tests demonstrated that Cry1Ac resistance in both the 
      knockout strains was incompletely recessive, and Cry1Ac resistance alleles were 
      located in the classic BtR-1 resistance locus that harbored the PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 
      genes, similar to the near-isogenic resistant NIL-R strain. Moreover, qualitative 
      toxin binding assays revealed that the binding of the Cry1Ac toxin to midgut brush 
      border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) in both knockout strains was dramatically reduced 
      compared to that in the susceptible DBM1Ac-S strain. In summary, our 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing study presents, for the first time, in vivo 
      reverse genetics evidence for both the ABCC2 and ABCC3 proteins as midgut functional 
      receptors for Bt Cry1 toxins in insects, which provides new insight into the pivotal 
      roles of both the ABCC2 and ABCC3 proteins in the complex molecular mechanism of 
      insect resistance to Bt Cry1 toxins.

AB  - This paper describes the formation of giant proteoliposomes containing 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) from a solution of small proteoliposomes that had been 
      deposited and partially dried on a film of agarose. This preparation method 
      generated a significant fraction of giant proteoliposomes that were free of 
      internalized vesicles, making it possible to determine the accessible liposome 
      volume. Measuring the intensity of the fluorescent substrate rhodamine 123 (Rho123) 
      inside and outside these giant proteoliposomes determined the concentration of 
      transported substrates of P-gp. Fitting a kinetic model to the fluorescence data 
      revealed the rate of passive diffusion as well as active transport by reconstituted 
      P-gp in the membrane. This approach determined estimates for the membrane 
      permeability coefficient (Ps) of passive diffusion and rate constants of active 
      transport (kT) by P-gp as a result of different experimental conditions. The Ps 
      value for Rho123 was larger in membranes containing P-gp under all assay conditions 
      than in membranes without P-gp indicating increased leakiness in the presence of 
      reconstituted transmembrane proteins. For P-gp liposomes, the kT value was 
      significantly higher in the presence of ATP than in its absence or in the presence 
      of ATP and the competitive inhibitor verapamil. This difference in kT values 
      verified that P-gp was functionally active after reconstitution and quantified the 
      rate of active transport. Lastly, patch clamp experiments on giant proteoliposomes 
      showed ion channel activity consistent with a chloride ion channel protein that 
      co-purified with P-gp. Together, these results demonstrate several advantages of 
      using giant rather than small proteoliposomes to characterize transport properties 
      of transport proteins and ion channels.

AB  - The multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is characterised by the ability to 
      bind and/or transport an astonishing array of drugs. This poly-specificity is 
      imparted by at least four pharmacologically distinct binding sites within the 
      transmembrane domain. Whether or not these sites are spatially distinct has remained 
      unclear. Biochemical and structural investigations have implicated a central cavity 
      as the likely location for the binding sites. In the present investigation, a number 
      of contact residues that are involved in drug binding were identified through 
      biochemical assays using purified, reconstituted P-gp. Drugs were selected to 
      represent each of the four pharmacologically distinct sites. Contact residues 
      important in rhodamine123 binding were identified in the central cavity of P-gp. 
      However, contact residues for the binding of vinblastine, paclitaxel and nicardipine 
      were located at the lipid-protein interface rather than the central cavity. A key 
      residue (F978) within the central cavity is believed to be involved in coupling drug 
      binding to nucleotide hydrolysis. Data observed in this investigation suggest the 
      presence of spatially distinct drug binding sites connecting through to a single

AB  - An engineered phiC31 "Disintegrase" able to make an attP site in Drosophila out of 
      an attR-attL pair is described. This was used to generate attP sites at genomic 
      locations where a mini-white (mini-w) transgene was subject to chromosomal position 
      effects (CPE). The first step was random genomic integration of a P-element-based 
      transposon with an insulated mini-w transgene. We then removed the upstream 
      insulator using FLP recombinase to detect CPE. Next mini-w and the downstream 
      insulator were "dis-integrated" leaving behind an attP site. The location is marked 
      by a yellow+ transgene that is flanked by loxP sites, so it can also be removed. 
      Using this system, we generated 10 new attP landing platforms. Three of these 
      showing strong activating CPE were selected for further analysis. We show that the 
      attP sites are functional by integrating in plasmids with attB sites. The CPE is 
      recapitulated and can be blocked by insulators. We show that a dimerized 215 bp 
      fragment of the 500 bp BEAF-dependent scs' insulator containing a high affinity BEAF 
      binding site blocks the CPE, while a monomer of the sequence is less effective. This 
      indicates that two BEAF binding sites make a stronger insulator than a single site. 
      This system could be useful for generating attP sites at prescreened sites for other 
      purposes, such as studying CPE in embryos or other tissues or for use with "trapped" 
      enhancers of interest.

TI  - An Overview of Genes From Cyberlindnera americana, a Symbiont Yeast Isolated From 
      the Gut of the Bark Beetle Dendroctonus rhizophagus (Curculionidae: Scolytinae), 
      Involved in the Detoxification Process Using Genome and Transcriptome Data.

AB  - Bark beetles from Dendroctonus genus promote ecological succession and nutrient 
      cycling in coniferous forests. However, they can trigger outbreaks leading to 
      important economic losses in the forest industry. Conifers have evolved resistance 
      mechanisms that can be toxic to insects but at the same time, bark beetles are 
      capable of overcoming tree barriers and colonize these habitats. In this sense, 
      symbiont yeasts present in the gut of bark beetles have been suggested to play a 
      role in the detoxification process of tree defensive chemicals. In the present 
      study, genes related to this process were identified and their response to a terpene 
      highly toxic to bark beetles and their symbionts was analyzed in the Cyberlindnera 
      americana yeast. The genome and transcriptome of C. americana (ChDrAdgY46) isolated 
      from the gut of Dendroctonus rhizophagus were presented. Genome analysis identified 
      5752 protein-coding genes and diverse gene families associated with the 
      detoxification process. The most abundant belonged to the Aldo-Keto Reductase 
      Superfamily, ATP-binding cassette Superfamily, and the Major Facilitator Superfamily 
      transporters. The transcriptome analysis of non-α-pinene stimulated and α-pinene 
      stimulated yeasts showed a significant expression of genes belonging to these 
      families. The activities demonstrated by the genes identified as Aryl-alcohol 
      dehydrogenase and ABC transporter under (+)-α-pinene suggest that they are 
      responsible, that C. americana is a dominant symbiont that resists high amounts of 
      monoterpenes inside the gut of bark beetles.

TI  - Effect of a Common Genetic Variant (p.V444A) in the Bile Salt Export Pump on the 
      Inhibition of Bile Acid Transport by Cholestatic Medications.
PG  - 1406-1411
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b01124 [doi]
AB  - The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is the primary canalicular transporter responsible 
      for the secretion of bile acids from hepatocytes into bile canaliculi, and 
      inhibition of this transporter has been associated with drug-induced liver injury 
      (DILI). A common variant (rs2287622; p.V444A) in the gene encoding BSEP has been 
      associated with an increased risk of cholestatic DILI. Although p.444V BSEP 
      (reference) and p.444A BSEP (variant) do not differ in their transport kinetics of 
      taurocholic acid (TCA), transport of the more abundant glycocholic acid (GCA) has 
      not been investigated. Importantly, differences in the susceptibility of p.444V and 
      p.444A BSEP to inhibition by drugs causing cholestatic DILI have not been 
      investigated. To address these issues, the transport kinetics of GCA were evaluated 
      by incubating membrane vesicles expressing either p.444V or p.444A BSEP with GCA 
      over a range of concentrations (1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μM). The abilities of 
      commonly used cholestatic medications to inhibit the transport of TCA and GCA by the 
      reference and variant proteins were compared. Resulting data indicated that GCA 
      transport kinetics for reference and variant BSEP followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics 
      and were not statistically different [ V(max) values of 1132 ± 246 and 959 ± 256 
      pmol min(-1) (mg of protein)(-1), respectively, and K(m) values of 32.7 ± 18.2 and 
      45.7 ± 25.5 μM, respectively]. There were no statistically significant differences 
      between the reference and variant BSEP in the inhibition of TCA or GCA transport by 
      the cholestatic drugs tested. In conclusion, differential inhibition of TCA or GCA 
      transport cannot account for an association between the variant BSEP and the risk 
      for cholestatic DILI due to the drugs tested.

TI  - Timing of Locomotor Recovery from Anoxia Modulated by the white Gene in Drosophila.
PG  - 787-97
LID - 10.1534/genetics.115.185066 [doi]
AB  - Locomotor recovery from anoxia follows the restoration of disordered ion 
      distributions and neuronal excitability. The time taken for locomotor recovery after 
      30 sec anoxia (around 10 min) is longer than the time for the propagation of action 
      potentials to be restored (<1 min) in Drosophila wild type. We report here that the 
      white (w) gene modulates the timing of locomotor recovery. Wild-type flies displayed 
      fast and consistent recovery of locomotion from anoxia, whereas mutants of w showed 
      significantly delayed and more variable recovery. Genetic analysis including serial 
      backcrossing revealed a strong association between the w locus and the timing of 
      locomotor recovery, and haplo-insufficient function of w(+) in promoting fast 
      recovery. The locomotor recovery phenotype was independent of classic eye 
      pigmentation, although both are associated with the w gene. Introducing up to four 
      copies of mini-white (mw(+)) into w1118 was insufficient to promote fast and 
      consistent locomotor recovery. However, flies carrying w(+) duplicated to the Y 
      chromosome showed wild-type-like fast locomotor recovery. Furthermore, Knockdown of 
      w by RNA interference (RNAi) in neurons but not glia delayed locomotor recovery, and 
      specifically, knockdown of w in subsets of serotonin neurons was sufficient to delay 
      the locomotor recovery. These data reveal an additional role for w in modulating the 
      timing of locomotor recovery from anoxia.

      ABCC2 Transporter Enhancing Insecticidal Activity of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac 
      Toxin.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin binds to midgut proteins, as cadherin (CAD) and 
      ABCC2 transporter, to form pores leading to larval death. In cell lines, 
      co-expression of CAD and ABCC2 enhance Cry1Ac toxicity significantly, but the 
      mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the expression of Helicoverpa armigera 
      CAD (HaCAD-GFP) in Hi5 cells induces susceptibility to Cry1Ac and enhanced Cry1Ac 
      toxicity when co-expressed with H. armigera ABCC2 (HaABCC2-GFP), since Cry1Ac 
      toxicity increased 735-fold compared to Hi5 cells expressing HaCAD-GFP alone or 
      28-fold compared to HaABCC2-GFP alone. In contrast, the expression of the Spodoptera 
      litura CAD (SlCAD-GFP) in Hi5 cells did not induce susceptibility to Cry1Ac nor it 
      potentiated Cry1Ac toxicity with HaABCC2-GFP. To identify the CAD regions involved 
      in the enhancement of Cry1Ac toxicity with ABCC2, the different CAD domains were 
      replaced between SlCAD-GFP and HaCad-GFP proteins, and cytotoxicity assays were 
      performed in Hi5 cells in the absence or presence of HaABCC2-GFP. The HaCAD 
      toxin-binding region (TB), specifically the CAD repeat-11, was necessary to enhance 
      Cry1Ac toxicity with ABCC2. We propose that CAD TB is involved in recruiting Cry1Ac 
      to localize it in a good position for its interaction with the ABCC2, resulting in 
      efficient toxin membrane insertion enhancing Cry1Ac toxicity.

AB  - Cry1A insecticidal toxins bind sequentially to different larval gut proteins 
      facilitating oligomerization, membrane insertion and pore formation. Cry1Ac 
      interaction with cadherin triggers oligomerization. However, a mutation in an ABC 
      transporter gene (ABCC2) is linked to Cry1Ac resistance in Plutella xylostella. 
      Cry1AcMod, engineered to lack helix α-1, was able to form oligomers without 
      cadherinbinding and effectively countered Cry1Ac resistance linked to ABCC2. Here we 
      analyzed Cry1Ac and Cry1AcMod binding and oligomerization by western blots using 
      brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from a strain of P. xylostella susceptible to 
      Cry1Ac (Geneva 88) and a strain with resistance to Cry1Ac (NO-QAGE) linked to an 
      ABCC2 mutation. Resistance correlated with lack of specific binding and reduced 
      oligomerization of Cry1Ac in BBMV from NO-QAGE. In contrast, Cry1AcMod bound 
      specifically and still formed oligomers in BBMV from both strains. We compared 
      association of pre-formed Cry1Ac oligomer, obtained by incubating Cry1Ac toxin with 
      a Manduca sexta cadherin fragment, with BBMV from both strains. Our results show 
      that pre-formed oligomers associate more efficiently with BBMV from Geneva 88 than 
      with BBMV from NO-QAGE, indicating that the ABCC2 mutation also affects the 
      association of Cry1Ac oligomer with the membrane. These data indicate, for the first 
      time, that ABCC2 facilitates Cry1Ac oligomerization and oligomer membrane insertion 
      in P. xylostella.

AB  - The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is a destructive pest in tropical and 
      subtropical areas. In this study, we performed transcriptome-wide analysis of the 
      fat body of B. dorsalis and obtained more than 59 million sequencing reads, which 
      were assembled into 27,787 unigenes with an average length of 591 bp. Among them, 
      17,442 (62.8%) unigenes matched known proteins in the NCBI database. The assembled 
      sequences were further annotated with gene ontology, cluster of orthologous group 
      terms, and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes. In depth analysis was performed 
      to identify genes putatively involved in immunity, detoxification, and energy 
      metabolism. Many new genes were identified including serpins, peptidoglycan 
      recognition proteins and defensins, which were potentially linked to immune defense. 
      Many detoxification genes were identified, including cytochrome P450s, glutathione 
      S-transferases and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Many new transcripts 
      possibly involved in energy metabolism, including fatty acid desaturases, lipases, 
      alpha amylases, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthases, were identified. Moreover, we 
      randomly selected some genes to examine their expression patterns in different 
      tissues by quantitative real-time PCR, which indicated that some genes exhibited fat 
      body-specific expression in B. dorsalis. The identification of a numerous 
      transcripts in the fat body of B. dorsalis laid the foundation for future studies on 
      the functions of these genes.

AB  - Biopesticides or transgenic crops based on Cry toxins from the soil bacterium 
      Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) effectively control agricultural insect pests. The 
      sustainable use of Bt biopesticides and Bt crops is threatened, however, by the 
      development of Cry resistance in the target pests. The diamondback moth, Plutella 
      xylostella (L.), is the first pest that developed resistance to a Bt biopesticide in 
      the field, and a recent study has shown that the resistance of P. xylostella to 
      Cry1Ac is caused by a mutation in an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene 
      (ABCC2). In this study, we report that down-regulation of a novel ABC transporter 
      gene from ABCG subfamily (Pxwhite) is associated with Cry1Ac resistance in P. 
      xylostella. The full-length cDNA sequence of Pxwhite was cloned and analyzed. 
      Spatial-temporal expression detection revealed that Pxwhite was expressed in all 
      tissues and developmental stages, and highest expressed in Malpighian tubule tissue 
      and in egg stage. Sequence variation analysis of Pxwhite indicated the absence of 
      constant non-synonymous mutations between susceptible and resistant strains, whereas 
      midgut transcript analysis showed that Pxwhite was remarkably reduced in all 
      resistant strains and further reduced when larvae of the moderately resistant SZ-R 
      strain were subjected to selection with Cry1Ac toxin. Furthermore, RNA interference 
      (RNAi)-mediated suppression of Pxwhite gene expression significantly reduced larval 
      susceptibility to Cry1Ac toxin, and genetic linkage analysis confirmed that 
      down-regulation of Pxwhite gene is tightly linked to Cry1Ac resistance in P. 
      xylostella. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that Pxwhite gene 
      is involved in Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella.

TI  - Phototactic personality in fruit flies and its suppression by serotonin and white.
PG  - 19834-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1211988109 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila typically move toward light (phototax positively) when startled. The 
      various species of Drosophila exhibit some variation in their respective mean 
      phototactic behaviors; however, it is not clear to what extent genetically identical 
      individuals within each species behave idiosyncratically. Such behavioral 
      individuality has indeed been observed in laboratory arthropods; however, the 
      neurobiological factors underlying individual-to-individual behavioral differences 
      are unknown. We developed "FlyVac," a high-throughput device for automatically 
      assessing phototaxis in single animals in parallel. We observed surprising 
      variability within every species and strain tested, including identically reared, 
      isogenic strains. In an extreme example, a domesticated strain of Drosophila 
      simulans harbored both strongly photopositive and strongly photonegative 
      individuals. The particular behavior of an individual fly is not heritable and, 
      because it persists for its lifetime, constitutes a model system for elucidating the 
      molecular mechanisms of personality. Although all strains assayed had greater than 
      expected variation (assuming binomial sampling), some had more than others, implying 
      a genetic basis. Using genetics and pharmacology, we identified the metabolite 
      transporter White and white-dependent serotonin as suppressors of phototactic 
      personality. Because we observed behavioral idiosyncrasy in all experimental groups, 
      we suspect it is present in most behaviors of most animals.

TI  - A P-Glycoprotein Is Linked to Resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry3Aa Toxin 
      in a Leaf Beetle.
LID - 362
AB  - Chrysomela tremula is a polyvoltine oligophagous leaf beetle responsible for massive 
      attacks on poplar trees. This beetle is an important model for understanding 
      mechanisms of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal toxins, because 
      a resistant C. tremula strain has been found that can survive and reproduce on 
      transgenic poplar trees expressing high levels of the Cry3Aa Bt toxin. Resistance to 
      Cry3Aa in this strain is recessive and is controlled by a single autosomal locus. We 
      used a larval midgut transcriptome for C. tremula to search for candidate resistance 
      genes. We discovered a mutation in an ABC protein, member of the B subfamily 
      homologous to P-glycoprotein, which is genetically linked to Cry3Aa resistance in C. 
      tremula. Cultured insect cells heterologously expressing this ABC protein swell and 
      lyse when incubated with Cry3Aa toxin. In light of previous findings in Lepidoptera 
      implicating A subfamily ABC proteins as receptors for Cry2A toxins and C subfamily 
      proteins as receptors for Cry1A and Cry1C toxins, this result suggests that ABC 
      proteins may be targets of insecticidal three-domain Bt toxins in Coleoptera as 
      well.

TI  - Landscape of Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division (RND)-Type Efflux Pumps in 
      Enterobacter cloacae Complex.
PG  - 2373-82
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02840-15 [doi]
AB  - In Gram-negative bacteria, the active efflux is an important mechanism of 
      antimicrobial resistance, but little is known about theEnterobacter cloacaecomplex 
      (ECC). It is mediated primarily by pumps belonging to the RND 
      (resistance-nodulation-cell division) family, and only AcrB, part of the AcrAB-TolC 
      tripartite system, was characterized in ECC. However, detailed genome sequence 
      analysis of the strainE. cloacaesubsp.cloacaeATCC 13047 revealed to us that 10 other 
      genes putatively coded for RND-type transporters. We then characterized the role of 
      all of these candidates by construction of corresponding deletion mutants, which 
      were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility to 36 compounds, their virulence 
      in the invertebrateGalleria mellonellamodel of infection, and their ability to form 
      biofilm. Only the ΔacrBmutant displayed significantly different phenotypes compared 
      to that of the wild-type strain: 4- to 32-fold decrease of MICs of several 
      antibiotics, antiseptics, and dyes, increased production of biofilm, and attenuated 
      virulence inG. mellonella In order to identify specific substrates of each pump, we 
      individually expressed intransall operons containing an RND pump-encoding gene into 
      the ΔacrBhypersusceptible strain. We showed that three other RND-type efflux systems 
      (ECL_00053-00055, ECL_01758-01759, and ECL_02124-02125) were able to partially 
      restore the wild-type phenotype and to superadd to and even enlarge the broad range 
      of antimicrobial resistance. This is the first global study assessing the role of 
      all RND efflux pumps chromosomally encoded by the ECC, which confirms the major role 
      of AcrB in both pathogenicity and resistance and the potential involvement of other 
      RND-type members in acquired resistance.

AB  - Translation of mRNAs is tightly regulated and constantly surveyed for errors. 
      Aberrant translation can trigger co-translational protein and RNA quality control 
      processes, impairments of which cause neurodegeneration by still poorly understood 
      mechanism(s). Here we show that quality control of translation of mitochondrial 
      outer membrane (MOM)-localized mRNA intersects with the turnover of damaged 
      mitochondria, both orchestrated by the mitochondrial kinase PINK1. Mitochondrial 
      damage causes stalled translation of complex-I 30 kDa subunit (C-I30) mRNA on MOM, 
      triggering the recruitment of co-translational quality control factors Pelo, ABCE1, 
      and NOT4 to the ribosome/mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complex. Damage-induced 
      ubiquitination of ABCE1 by NOT4 generates poly-ubiquitin signals that attract 
      autophagy receptors to MOM to initiate mitophagy. In the Drosophila PINK1 model, 
      these factors act synergistically to restore mitophagy and neuromuscular tissue 
      integrity. Thus ribosome-associated co-translational quality control generates an 
      early signal to trigger mitophagy. Our results have broad therapeutic implications 
      for the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2 (MRP2) Mediated Transport of 
      Oxaliplatin-Derived Platinum in Membrane Vesicles.

AB  - The platinum-based anticancer drug oxaliplatin is important clinically in cancer 
      treatment. However, the role of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) in 
      controlling oxaliplatin membrane transport, in vivo handling, toxicity and 
      therapeutic responses is unclear. In the current study, preparations of 
      MRP2-expressing and control membrane vesicles, containing inside-out orientated 
      vesicles, were used to directly characterise the membrane transport of 
      oxaliplatin-derived platinum measured by inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometry. Oxaliplatin inhibited the ATP-dependent accumulation of the model MRP2 
      fluorescent probe, 5(6)-carboxy-2,'7'-dichlorofluorescein, in MRP2-expressing 
      membrane vesicles. MRP2-expressing membrane vesicles accumulated up to 19-fold more 
      platinum during their incubation with oxaliplatin and ATP as compared to control 
      membrane vesicles and in the absence of ATP. The rate of ATP-dependent MRP2-mediated 
      active transport of oxaliplatin-derived platinum increased non-linearly with 
      increasing oxaliplatin exposure concentration, approaching a plateau value (Vmax) of 
      2680 pmol Pt/mg protein/10 minutes (95%CI, 2010 to 3360 pmol Pt/mg protein/10 
      minutes), with the half-maximal platinum accumulation rate (Km) at an oxaliplatin 
      exposure concentration of 301 μM (95% CI, 163 to 438 μM), in accordance with 
      Michaelis-Menten kinetics (r2 = 0.954). MRP2 inhibitors (myricetin and MK571) 
      reduced the ATP-dependent accumulation of oxaliplatin-derived platinum in 
      MRP2-expressing membrane vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner. To identify 
      whether oxaliplatin, or perhaps a degradation product, was the likely substrate for 
      this active transport, HPLC studies were undertaken showing that oxaliplatin 
      degraded slowly in membrane vesicle incubation buffer containing chloride ions and 
      glutathione, with approximately 95% remaining intact after a 10 minute incubation 
      time and a degradation half-life of 2.24 hours (95%CI, 2.08 to 2.43 hours). In 
      conclusion, MRP2 mediates the ATP-dependent active membrane transport of 
      oxaliplatin-derived platinum. Intact oxaliplatin and its anionic monochloro oxalate 
      ring-opened intermediate appear likely candidates as substrates for MRP2-mediated 
      transport.

TI  - Hybrid nonviral/viral vector systems for improved piggyBac DNA transposon in vivo 
      delivery.
PG  - 667-74
LID - 10.1038/mt.2014.254 [doi]
AB  - The DNA transposon piggyBac is a potential therapeutic agent for multiple genetic 
      diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Recombinant piggyBac transposon and 
      transposase are typically codelivered by plasmid transfection; however, plasmid 
      delivery is inefficient in somatic cells in vivo and is a barrier to the therapeutic 
      application of transposon-based vector systems. Here, we investigate the potential 
      for hybrid piggyBac/viral vectors to transduce cells and support 
      transposase-mediated genomic integration of the transposon. We tested both 
      adenovirus (Ad) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) as transposon delivery vehicles. An 
      Ad vector expressing hyperactive insect piggyBac transposase (iPB7) was codelivered. 
      We show transposase-dependent transposition activity and mapped integrations in 
      mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo from each viral vector platform. We also 
      demonstrate efficient and persistent transgene expression following nasal delivery 
      of piggyBac/viral vectors to mice. Furthermore, using piggyBac/Ad expressing Cystic 
      Fibrosis transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), we show persistent correction 
      of chloride current in well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway 
      epithelial cells derived from CF patients. Combining the emerging technologies of 
      DNA transposon-based vectors with well-studied adenoviral and AAV delivery provides 
      new tools for in vivo gene transfer and presents an exciting opportunity to increase 
      the delivery efficiency for therapeutic genes such as CFTR.

AB  - Understanding the mechanism of Bt resistance is one of the key elements of the 
      effective application of Bt in pest control. The lepidopteran model insect, the 
      silkworm, demonstrates qualities that make it an ideal species to use in achieving 
      this understanding. We screened 45 strains of silkworm (Bombyx mori) using a Cry1Ab 
      toxin variant. The sensitivity levels of the strains varied over a wide range. A 
      resistant strain (P50) and a phylogenetically related susceptible strain (Dazao) 
      were selected to profile the expressions of 12 Bt resistance-related genes. The SNPs 
      in these genes were detected based on EST analysis and were validated by 
      allelic-specific PCR. A comparison of allelic-specific expression between P50 and 
      Dazao showed that the transcript levels of heterozygous genes containing two alleles 
      rather than an imbalanced allelic expression contribute more to the resistance of 
      P50 against Bt. The responses of the allelic-specific expression to Bt in hybrid 
      larvae were then investigated. The results showed that the gene expression pattern 
      of an ATP-binding cassette transporter C2 (ABCC2) and an aminopeptidase N (APN3), 
      changed in an allelic-specific manner, with the increase of the resistant allele 
      expression correlated with larval survival. The results suggest that a 
      trans-regulatory mechanism in ABCC2 and APN3 allelic-specific expression is involved 
      in the insect's response to the Bt toxin. The potential role of allelic-specific 
      gene regulation in insect resistance to Bt toxins is discussed.

AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 
      superfamily. This multidrug transporter utilizes energy from ATP hydrolysis for the 
      efflux of a variety of hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds including anticancer 
      drugs. Most of the substrates and modulators of P-gp stimulate its basal ATPase 
      activity, although some inhibit it. The molecular mechanisms that are in play in 
      either case are unknown. In this report, mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies 
      of P-gp led to the identification of a pair of phenylalanine-tyrosine structural 
      motifs in the transmembrane region that mediate the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by 
      certain drugs (zosuquidar, elacridar and tariquidar), with high affinity (IC50's 
      ranging from 10 to 30nM). Upon mutation of any of these residues, drugs that inhibit 
      the ATPase activity of P-gp switch to stimulation of the activity. Molecular 
      modeling revealed that the phenylalanine residues F978 and F728 interact with 
      tyrosine residues Y953 and Y310, respectively, in an edge-to-face conformation, 
      which orients the tyrosines in such a way that they establish hydrogen-bond contacts 
      with the inhibitor. Biochemical investigations along with transport studies in 
      intact cells showed that the inhibitors bind at a high affinity site to produce 
      inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and transport function. Upon mutation, they bind at 
      lower affinity sites, stimulating ATP hydrolysis and only poorly inhibiting 
      transport. These results also reveal that screening chemical compounds for their 
      ability to inhibit the basal ATP hydrolysis can be a reliable tool to identify 
      modulators with high affinity for P-gp.

AB  - The cadherin-like protein in lepidopteran insects, known as a receptor for Bacillus 
      thuringiensis Cry1A toxins, is a single-pass membrane protein that can be divided 
      into extracellular and intracellular regions. The extracellular region is important 
      for toxin binding and oligomerization, whereas the role of the intracellular region 
      during Cry1A intoxication is unclear. In the present study, we generated a deletion 
      mutant of Bombyx mori cadherin-like protein (BtR175) that lacked the intracellular 
      region to investigate its role in mediating Cry1A toxicity. Like wild-type BtR175, 
      the mutant protein conferred susceptibility to Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxins in Sf9 
      cells, suggesting that the intracellular region is not required to mediate 
      intoxication. The deletion mutant maintained another role of cadherin-like proteins; 
      that it, synergistic activity with B. mori ABC transporter C2 (ABCC2) when mediating 
      Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxicity. In addition, we evaluated the effects of reagents that 
      have been reported to inhibit Cry1A toxicity (e.g., protein kinase A inhibitors, 
      EDTA, and sucrose) on Cry1A toxicity in BtR175-expressing cells. Our results suggest 
      that Cry1Aa-induced cell death in BtR175-expressing cells was not caused by signal 
      transduction but by osmotic lysis. Overall, our data indicate that BtR175 mediates 
      the toxicity of Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab toxins entirely via its extracellular region. They 
      also indicate that the synergism between cadherin-like protein and ABCC2 occurs 
      outside of cells or in the cell membrane.

TI  - Impact of probe compound in MRP2 vesicular transport assays.
PG  - 100-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejps.2012.02.016 [doi]
AB  - MRP2 is an efflux transporter that is expressed mainly in the canalicular membrane 
      of hepatocytes, where it expels polar and ionic compounds into the bile. MRP2 is 
      also present in the apical membrane of enterocytes and epithelial cells of proximal 
      tubules of the kidney. Inhibition of MRP2 transport can lead to the accumulation of 
      metabolites and other MRP2 substrates up to toxic levels in these cells. The 
      transport properties of MRP2 are frequently studied with the vesicular transport 
      assay. The assay identifies compounds that interact with MRP2 by measuring the 
      effect of a compound on the transport of a radioactively labeled or fluorescent 
      probe. We have compared the effect of eight selected test compounds (quercetin, 
      disopyramide, paracetamol, indomethacin, diclofenac, estrone-3-sulfate, budesonide, 
      and thioridazine) on the MRP2-mediated transport of three commonly used probes: 
      5(6)-carboxy-2,7-dichlorofluorescein, leukotriene C4 and 
      estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG). Five of the test compounds had different 
      probe-dependent effects on the MRP2-mediated transport, suggesting differences in 
      the transport mechanism of the probes. Our results underline the complexity of 
      substrate recognition by these efflux transporters and the difficulties in directly 
      comparing results obtained with different assays, especially when different probes 
      are used.

TI  - Down-regulation of aminopeptidase N and ABC transporter subfamily G transcripts in 
      Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac resistant Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Lepidoptera: 
      Crambidae).
PG  - 835-851
LID - 10.7150/ijbs.18868 [doi]
AB  - The Asian corn borer (ACB), Ostrinia furnacalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a 
      highly destructive pest of cultivated maize throughout East Asia. Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) crystalline protein (Cry) toxins cause mortality by a mechanism 
      involving pore formation or signal transduction following toxin binding to receptors 
      along the midgut lumen of susceptible insects, but this mechanism and mutations 
      therein that lead to resistance are not fully understood. In the current study, 
      quantitative comparisons were made among midgut expressed transcripts from O. 
      furnacalis susceptible (ACB-BtS) and laboratory selected strains resistant to Cry1Ab 
      (ACB-AbR) and Cry1Ac toxins (ACB-AcR) when feeding on non-Bt diet. From a combined 
      de novo transcriptome assembly of 83,370 transcripts, ORFs of ≥ 100 amino acids were 
      predicted and annotated for 28,940 unique isoforms derived from 12,288 transcripts. 
      Transcriptome-wide expression estimated from RNA-seq read depths predicted 
      significant down-regulation of transcripts for previously known Bt resistance genes, 
      aminopeptidase N1 (apn1) and apn3, as well as a putative ATP binding cassette 
      transporter group G (abcg) gene in both ACB-AbR and -AcR (log(2)[fold-change] ≥ 
      1.36; P < 0.0001). The transcripts that were most highly differentially regulated in 
      both ACB-AbR and -AcR compared to ACB-BtS (log(2)[fold-change] ≥ 2.0; P < 0.0001) 
      included up- and down-regulation of serine proteases, storage proteins and 
      cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, as well as up-regulation of genes with predicted 
      transport function. This study predicted the significant down-regulation of 
      transcripts for previously known Bt resistance genes, aminopeptidase N1 (apn1) and 
      apn3, as well as abccg gene in both ACB-AbR and -AcR. These data are important for 
      the understanding of systemic differences between Bt resistant and susceptible 
      genotypes.

PG  - 200-207
LID - 10.1080/19336934.2017.1304332 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster the progenitors of the germ-line stem cells, the 
      primordial germ cells (PGCs) are formed on the outside surface of the early embryo, 
      while the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs) are specified during 
      mid-embryogenesis. To form the primitive embryonic gonad, the PGCs travel from 
      outside of the embryo, across the mid-gut and then migrate through the mesoderm to 
      the SGPs. The migratory path of PGCs is dictated by a series of attractive and 
      repulsive cues. Studies in our laboratory have shown that one of the key 
      chemoattractants is the Hedgehog (Hh) ligand. Although, Hh is expressed in other 
      cell types, the long-distance transmission of this ligand is specifically 
      potentiated in the SGPs by the hmgcr isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. The distant 
      transmission of the Hh ligand is gated by restricting expression of hmgcr to the 
      SGPs. This is particularly relevant in light of the recent findings that an ABC 
      transporter, mdr49 also acts in a mesoderm specific manner to release the germ cell 
      attractant. Our studies have demonstrated that mdr49 functions in hh signaling 
      likely via its role in the transport of cholesterol. Given the importance of 
      cholesterol in the processing and long distance transmission of the Hh ligand, this 
      observation has opened up an exciting avenue concerning the possible role of 
      components of the sterol transport machinery in PGC migration.

      xylostella (L.), is the first pest to develop resistance to Bt biopesticides in the 
      open field, which renders it an excellent model to explore the molecular basis of Bt 
      resistance in insects. Our previous midgut transcriptome and RNA-Seq profiles showed 
      that the P-glycoprotein gene PxABCB1 was down-regulated in two Cry1Ac-resistant P. 
      xylostella strains, suggesting its potential involvement in Cry1Ac resistance in P. 
      xylostella. RESULTS: In this study, the bona fide full-length cDNA sequence of the 
      PxABCB1 gene was cloned and analyzed, and the expression of the PxABCB1 gene was 
      detected in all tissues and developmental stages, with the highest expression in 
      midgut tissue and the female adult stage. Although no consistent non-synonymous 
      mutations were identified between the susceptible and resistant strains, PxABCB1 
      gene expression was remarkably decreased in all resistant strains, and the 
      association was further validated by Cry1Ac selection in the moderately resistant 
      SZ-R strain. Moreover, knockdown of the PxABCB1 gene expression resulted in 
      significantly reduced larval susceptibility to Cry1Ac toxin in the DBM1Ac-S strain, 
      and decreased expression of the PxABCB1 gene was tightly linked to Cry1Ac resistance 
      in P. xylostella. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that down-regulation of the 
      PxABCB1 gene is associated with both laboratory-selected and field-evolved Cry1Ac 
      resistance in P. xylostella. This knowledge will be conducive to further elucidating 
      the complicated molecular basis of Bt resistance and developing new insect 
      resistance management tactics. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Specimens of neotropical Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) were collected and identified 
      morphologically. We amplified three genes for phylogenetic analysis-the single copy 
      nuclear white and CAD genes, and the COI barcode region. Since we had multiple 
      specimens for most species we were able to test how well the single or combined 
      genes were able to corroborate morphologically defined species by placing the 
      species into exclusive groups. We found that single genes, including the COI barcode 
      region, were poor at confirming species, but that the three genes combined were able 
      to do so much better. This has implications for species identification, species 
      delimitation, and species discovery, and we caution that single genes are not 
      enough. Higher level groupings were partially resolved with some well-supported 
      groupings, whereas others were found to be either polyphyletic or paraphyletic. 
      There were examples of known groups, such as the Myzorhynchella Section, which were 
      poorly supported with single genes but were well supported with combined genes. From 
      this we can infer that more sequence data will be needed in order to show more 
      higher-level groupings with good support. We got unambiguously good support 
      (0.94-1.0 Bayesian posterior probability) from all DNA-based analyses for a grouping 
      of An. dunhami with An. nuneztovari and An. goeldii, and because of this and because 
      of morphological similarities we propose that An. dunhami be included in the 
      Nuneztovari Complex. We obtained phylogenetic corroboration for new species which 
      had been recognised by morphological differences; these will need to be formally 
      described and named.

AB  - ATP binding cassette type-C (ABCC) transporters move molecules across cell membranes 
      upon hydrolysis of ATP; however, their coupling of ATP hydrolysis to substrate 
      transport remains elusive. Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein (DMRP) 
      is the functional ortholog of human long ABCC transporters, with similar substrate 
      and inhibitor specificity, but higher activity. Exploiting its high activity, we 
      kinetically dissected the catalytic mechanism of DMRP by using E(2)-d-glucuronide 
      (E(2)G), the physiologic substrate of human ABCC. We examined the DMRP-mediated 
      interdependence of ATP and E(2)G in biochemical assays. We observed E(2)G-dependent 
      ATPase activity to be biphasic at subsaturating ATP concentrations, which implies at 
      least 2 E(2)G binding sites on DMRP. Furthermore, transport measurements indicated 
      strong nonreciprocal cooperativity between ATP and E(2)G. In addition to confirming 
      these findings, our kinetic modeling with the Complex Pathway Simulator indicated a 
      10-fold decrease in the E(2)G-mediated activation of ATP hydrolysis upon saturation 
      of the second E(2)G binding site. Surprisingly, the binding of the second E(2)G 
      allowed for substrate transport with a constant rate, which tightly coupled ATP 
      hydrolysis to transport. In summary, we show that the second E(2)G binding-similar 
      to human ABCC2-allosterically stimulates transport activity of DMRP. Our data 
      suggest that this is achieved by a significant increase in the coupling of ATP 
      hydrolysis to transport.-Karasik, A., Ledwitch, K. V., Arányi, T., Váradi, A.,

AB  - Toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used widely for insect 
      control in sprays and transgenic plants, but their efficacy is reduced when pests 
      evolve resistance. Previous work showed that mutations in a gene encoding the 
      transporter protein ABCC2 are linked with resistance to Bt toxins Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac or 
      both in four species of Lepidoptera. Here we compared the ABCC2 gene of Helicoverpa 
      armigera (HaABCC2) between susceptible strains and a laboratory-selected strain with 
      >1,000-fold resistance to Cry1Ac relative its susceptible parent strain. We 
      discovered a 73-base pair (bp) insertion in the cDNA of the resistant strain that 
      generates a premature stop codon expected to yield a truncated ABCC2 protein. 
      Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed that this insertion is an intron that is not 
      spliced out because of a 6-bp deletion at its splicing site. Analysis of progeny 
      from crosses revealed tight genetic linkage between HaABCC2 and resistance to 
      Cry1Ac. These results provide the first evidence that mis-splicing of a gene 
      encoding an ABCC2 protein confers resistance to a Bt toxin.

AB  - Ecdysone is involved in regulation of embryonic diapause in the silkworm, Bombyx 
      mori. However, its mechanism still remains unclear. To explore the role of 
      ecdysteroidogenic pathway (EP) genes in diapause process of bivoltine B. mori, the 
      eggs of "Qiufeng", a bivoltine strain, were used as the study materials and arranged 
      into diapause eggs producers (DEPs) and non-diapause eggs producers (NDEPs), 
      respectively. The differential expression of EP genes between two groups was 
      analysed during the early pupal stage. The expression of Shadow was significantly 
      increased in the NDEPs in day-3 pupae and reached the peak simultaneously, 
      indicating that Shadow was in coincidence with diapause process. To validate this 
      hypothesis, a repression of Shadow by RNA interference was performed in day-2 pupae 
      of NDEPs. The expression of Shadow was downregulated by RNAi, and βFtz-F1, a 
      downstream gene of EP, was also decreased. Furthermore, the genes encoding the 
      kynurenine-synthetase were upregulated in the ovary, and Brown, AdenoK which link 
      Shadow to the kynurenine-synthase gene were also upregulated in the fat body. The 
      progeny eggs appeared a light purple colour at 48 h after oviposition, revealing a 
      certain tendency to diapause. We speculate that inhibition of Shadow upregulates 
      3-hydroxy-kynurenine synthesis by increasing the expression of Brown and AdenoK. In 
      addition, Shadow was cloned, and expressed in E. coli for further functional study

TI  - Genome of the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida, Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), a 
      worldwide parasite of social bee colonies, provides insights into detoxification and 
      herbivory.

LID - giy138
AB  - BACKGROUND: The small hive beetle (Aethina tumida; ATUMI) is an invasive parasite of 
      bee colonies. ATUMI feeds on both fruits and bee nest products, facilitating its 
      spread and increasing its impact on honey bees and other pollinators. We have 
      sequenced and annotated the ATUMI genome, providing the first genomic resources for 
      this species and for the Nitidulidae, a beetle family that is closely related to the 
      extraordinarily species-rich clade of beetles known as the Phytophaga. ATUMI thus 
      provides a contrasting view as a neighbor for one of the most successful known 
      animal groups. RESULTS: We present a robust genome assembly and a gene set 
      possessing 97.5% of the core proteins known from the holometabolous insects. The 
      ATUMI genome encodes fewer enzymes for plant digestion than the genomes of 
      wood-feeding beetles but nonetheless shows signs of broad metabolic plasticity. 
      Gustatory receptors are few in number compared to other beetles, especially 
      receptors with known sensitivity (in other beetles) to bitter substances. In 
      contrast, several gene families implicated in detoxification of insecticides and 
      adaptation to diverse dietary resources show increased copy numbers. The presence 
      and diversity of homologs involved in detoxification differ substantially from the 
      bee hosts of ATUMI. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insights into the genomic 
      basis for local adaption and invasiveness in ATUMI and a blueprint for control 
      strategies that target this pest without harming their honey bee hosts. A minimal 
      set of gustatory receptors is consistent with the observation that, once a host 
      colony is invaded, food resources are predictable. Unique detoxification pathways 
      and pathway members can help identify which treatments might control this species 
      even in the presence of honey bees, which are notoriously sensitive to pesticides.

TI  - The grasshopper: a novel model for assessing vertebrate brain uptake.
PG  - 211-8
LID - 10.1124/jpet.113.205476 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop a blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability 
      model that is applicable in the drug discovery phase. The BBB ensures proper neural 
      function, but it restricts many drugs from entering the brain, and this complicates 
      the development of new drugs against central nervous system diseases. Many in vitro 
      models have been developed to predict BBB permeability, but the permeability 
      characteristics of the human BBB are notoriously complex and hard to predict. 
      Consequently, one single suitable BBB permeability screening model, which is 
      generally applicable in the early drug discovery phase, does not yet exist. A new 
      refined ex vivo insect-based BBB screening model that uses an intact, viable whole 
      brain under controlled in vitro-like exposure conditions is presented. This model 
      uses intact brains from desert locusts, which are placed in a well containing the 
      compound solubilized in an insect buffer. After a limited time, the brain is removed 
      and the compound concentration in the brain is measured by conventional liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data presented here include 25 known drugs, 
      and the data show that the ex vivo insect model can be used to measure the brain 
      uptake over the hemolymph-brain barrier of drugs and that the brain uptake shows 
      linear correlation with in situ perfusion data obtained in vertebrates. Moreover, 
      this study shows that the insect ex vivo model is able to identify P-glycoprotein 
      (Pgp) substrates, and the model allows differentiation between low-permeability 
      compounds and compounds that are Pgp substrates.

TI  - Direct interaction of avermectin with epidermal growth factor receptor mediates the 
      penetration resistance in Drosophila larvae.
PG  - 150231
LID - 10.1098/rsob.150231 [doi]
LID - 150231
AB  - With the widespread use of avermectins (AVMs) for managing parasitic and 
      agricultural pests, the resistance of worms and insects to AVMs has emerged as a 
      serious threat to human health and agriculture worldwide. The reduced penetration of 
      AVMs is one of the main reasons for the development of the resistance to the 
      chemicals. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we use 
      the larvae of Drosophila melanogaster as the model organism to explore the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the development of penetration resistance to AVMs. We clearly 
      show that the chitin layer is thickened and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) is overexpressed in the AVM-resistant larvae epidermis. We reveal that the 
      activation of the transcription factor Relish by the over-activated epidermal growth 
      factor receptor (EGFR)/AKT/ERK pathway induces the overexpression of the chitin 
      synthases DmeCHS1/2 and P-gp in the resistant larvae. Interestingly, we discover for 
      the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that AVM directly interacts with EGFR 
      and leads to the activation of the EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway, which activates the 
      transcription factor Relish and induces the overexpression of DmeCHS1/2 and P-gp. 
      These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      development of penetration resistance to drugs.

TI  - Target organ specific activity of drosophila MRP (ABCC1) moderates developmental 
      toxicity of methylmercury.
PG  - 425-35
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfu095 [doi]
AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous and persistent neurotoxin that poses a risk to 
      human health. Although the mechanisms of MeHg toxicity are not fully understood, 
      factors that contribute to susceptibility are even less well known. Studies of human 
      gene polymorphisms have identified a potential role for the multidrug 
      resistance-like protein (MRP/ABCC) family, ATP-dependent transporters, in MeHg 
      susceptibility. MRP transporters have been shown to be important for MeHg excretion 
      in adult mouse models, but their role in moderating MeHg toxicity during development 
      has not been explored. We therefore investigated effects of manipulating expression 
      levels of MRP using a Drosophila development assay. Drosophila MRP (dMRP) is 
      homologous to human MRP1-4 (ABCC1-4), sharing 50% identity and 67% similarity with 
      MRP1. A greater susceptibility to MeHg is seen in dMRP mutant flies, demonstrated by 
      reduced rates of eclosion on MeHg-containing food. Furthermore, targeted knockdown 
      of dMRP expression using GAL4>UAS RNAi methods demonstrates a tissue-specific 
      function for dMRP in gut, Malpighian tubules, and the nervous system in moderating 
      developmental susceptibility to MeHg. Using X-ray synchrotron fluorescence imaging, 
      these same tissues were also identified as the highest Hg-accumulating tissues in 
      fly larvae. Moreover, higher levels of Hg are seen in dMRP mutant larvae compared 
      with a control strain fed an equivalent dose of MeHg. In sum, these data demonstrate 
      that dMRP expression, both globally and within Hg-targeted organs, has a profound 
      effect on susceptibility to MeHg in developing flies. Our findings point to a 
      potentially novel and specific role for dMRP in neurons in the protection against 
      MeHg. Finally, this experimental system provides a tractable model to evaluate human 
      polymorphic variants of MRP and other gene variants relevant to genetic studies of 
      mercury-exposed populations.

TI  - Dibutyl Phthalate Exposure Disrupts Evolutionarily Conserved Insulin and 
      Glucagon-Like Signaling in Drosophila Males.
PG  - 2309-21
LID - 10.1210/en.2015-2006 [doi]
AB  - Phthalate diesters are commonly used as industrial plasticisers, as well as in 
      cosmetics and skin care products, as a result people are constantly exposed to these 
      xenobiotics. Recent epidemiological studies have found a correlation between 
      circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes, whereas animal studies indicate 
      that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling. Nonetheless, how 
      phthalates interfere with metabolic function is still unclear. Here, we show that 
      feeding Drosophila males the xenobiotic dibutyl phthalate (DBP) affects conserved 
      insulin- and glucagon-like signaling. We report that raising flies on food 
      containing DBP leads to starvation resistance, increased lipid storage, 
      hyperglycemia, and hyperphagia. We go on to show that the starvation-resistance 
      phenotype can be rescued by overexpression of the glucagon analogue adipokinetic 
      hormone (Akh). Furthermore, although acute DBP exposure in adult flies is able to 
      affect insulin levels, only chronic feeding influences Akh expression. We establish 
      that raising flies on DBP-containing food or feeding adults DBP food affects the 
      expression of homologous genes involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism (AHR 
      [Drosophila ss], NR1I2 [Hr96], ABCB1 [MDR50], ABCC3 [MRP], and CYP3A4 [Cyp9f2]). 
      Finally, we determined that the expression of these genes is also influenced by Akh. 
      Our results provide comprehensive evidence that DBP can disrupt metabolism in 
      Drosophila males, by regulating genes involved in glucose, lipid, and xenobiotic 
      metabolism.

TI  - Neurodegeneration caused by polyglutamine expansion is regulated by P-glycoprotein 
      in Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 857-70
LID - 10.1534/genetics.113.155077 [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide CAG repeat disorders are caused by expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      domains in certain proteins leading to fatal neurodegenerative disorders and are 
      characterized by accumulation of inclusion bodies in the neurons. Clearance of these 
      inclusion bodies holds the key to improve the disease phenotypes, which affects 
      basic cellular processes such as transcription, protein degradation and cell 
      signaling. In the present study, we show that P-glycoprotein (P-gp), originally 
      identified as a causative agent of multidrug-resistant cancer cells, plays an 
      important role in ameliorating the disease phenotype. Using a Drosophila transgenic 
      strain that expresses a stretch of 127 glutamine repeats, we demonstrate that 
      enhancing P-gp levels reduces eye degeneration caused by expression of polyQ, 
      whereas reducing it increases the severity of the disease. Increase in polyQ 
      inclusion bodies represses the expression of mdr genes, suggesting a functional link 
      between P-gp and polyQ. P-gp up-regulation restores the defects in the actin 
      organization and precise array of the neuronal connections caused by inclusion 
      bodies. β-Catenin homolog, Armadillo, also interacts with P-gp and regulates the 
      accumulation of inclusion bodies. These results thus show that P-gp and polyQ 
      interact with each other, and changing P-gp levels can directly affect 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - Insecticidal activity of NK-17 was evaluated both in laboratory and in field. It was 
      found that the toxicity of NK-17 against S. exigua was 1.93 times and 2.69 times 
      those of hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron respectively, and the toxicity of NK-17 
      against P. xylostella was 1.36 times and 1.90 times those of hexaflumuron and 
      chlorfluazuron respectively, and the toxicity of NK-17 against M. separate was 18.24 
      times those of hexaflumuron in laboratory, and 5% NK-17 EC at 60 g a.i ha(-1) can 
      control S. exigua and P. xylostella with the best control efficiency of about 89% 
      and over 88% respectively in Changsha and Tianjin in field. The insecticidal 
      mechanism of NK-17 was explored for the first time by utilizing the fluorescence 
      polarization method. NK-17 could bind to sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) of B. germanica 
      with stronger affinity comparing to diflubenzuron and glibenclamide, which suggested 
      that NK-17 may also act on the site of SUR to inhibit the chitin synthesis in insect 
      body and the result can well explain that NK-17 exhibited stronger toxicity against 
      B. germanica than diflubenzuron and glibenclamide in vivo.

PG  - e1005450
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005450 [doi]

AB  - Evolution of pest resistance reduces the efficacy of insecticidal proteins from the 
      gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) used widely in sprays and 
      transgenic crops. Recent efforts to delay pest adaptation to Bt crops focus 
      primarily on combinations of two or more Bt toxins that kill the same pest, but this 
      approach is often compromised because resistance to one Bt toxin causes 
      cross-resistance to others. Thus, integration of Bt toxins with alternative controls 
      that do not exhibit such cross-resistance is urgently needed. The ideal scenario of 
      negative cross-resistance, where selection for resistance to a Bt toxin increases 
      susceptibility to alternative controls, has been elusive. Here we discovered that 
      selection of the global crop pest, Helicoverpa armigera, for >1000-fold resistance 
      to Bt toxin Cry1Ac increased susceptibility to abamectin and spineotram, 
      insecticides derived from the soil bacteria Streptomyces avermitilis and 
      Saccharopolyspora spinosa, respectively. Resistance to Cry1Ac did not affect 
      susceptibility to the cyclodiene, organophospate, or pyrethroid insecticides tested. 
      Whereas previous work demonstrated that the resistance to Cry1Ac in the strain 
      analyzed here is conferred by a mutation disrupting an ATP-binding cassette protein 
      named ABCC2, the new results show that increased susceptibility to abamectin is 
      genetically linked with the same mutation. Moreover, RNAi silencing of HaABCC2 not 
      only decreased susceptibility to Cry1Ac, it also increased susceptibility to 
      abamectin. The mutation disrupting ABCC2 reduced removal of abamectin in live larvae 
      and in transfected Hi5 cells. The results imply that negative cross-resistance 
      occurs because the wild type ABCC2 protein plays a key role in conferring 
      susceptibility to Cry1Ac and in decreasing susceptibility to abamectin. The negative 
      cross-resistance between a Bt toxin and other bacterial insecticides reported here 
      may facilitate more sustainable pest control.

AB  - Avermectin (AVM) is a macrocyclic lactone agent widely used as a nematicide, 
      acaricide and insecticide in veterinary medicine and plant protection. 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds, 
      and is involved in multidrug resistance. To understand the development of AVM 
      resistance in invertebrates, we investigated the mechanisms by which AVM affected 
      P-gp expression in Drosophila S2 cells. We found that AVM induced upregulation of 
      P-gp protein expression, increased P-gp ATPase activity and enhanced cellular efflux 
      of the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 from cells. Furthermore, we observed that 
      AVM-induced expression of P-gp was due to elevation of intracellular calcium 
      concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). This occurred both directly, by activating calcium ion 
      channels, and indirectly, by activating chloride ion channels. These results are 
      supported by our observations that verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, and niflumic 
      acid, a chloride channel antagonist, significantly attenuated AVM-induced 
      [Ca(2+)](i) elevation, thereby reducing P-gp expression. Inhibition of P-gp with 
      anti-P-gp antibody or cyclosporine A (a P-gp inhibitor) reduced the AVM-induced 
      elevation of [Ca(2+)](i), implying that P-gp and [Ca(2+)](i) regulate each other. 
      Finally, we found that trifluoperazine, a calmodulin inhibitor, and pyrrolidine 
      dithiocarbamic acid, an NF-κB inhibitor, attenuated the AVM-induced expression of 
      P-gp, suggesting that AVM induces P-gp protein expression via the calmodulin/Relish 
      (NF-κB) signaling pathway.

AB  - Re-emergence of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and yellow fever, which are 
      both transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, has been correlated with insecticide 
      resistance. P-glycoproteins (P-gps) are ATP-dependent efflux pumps that are involved 
      in the transport of substrates across membranes. Some of these proteins have been 
      implicated in multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, we identified a putative 
      P-glycoprotein in the Ae. aegypti database based on its significantly high identity 
      with Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, Drosophila melanogaster and human 
      P-gps. The basal ATPase activity of ATP-binding cassette transporters in larvae was 
      significantly increased in the presence of MDR modulators (verapamil and quinidine). 
      An eightfold increase in Ae. aegypti P-gp (AaegP-gp) gene expression was detected in 
      temephos-treated larvae as determined by quantitative PCR. To analyse the potential 
      role of AaegP-gp in insecticide efflux, a temephos larvicide assay was performed in 
      the presence of verapamil. The results showed an increase of 24% in temephos 
      toxicity, which is in agreement with the efflux reversing effect. RNA interference 
      (RNAi)-mediated silencing of the AaegP-gp gene caused a significant increase in 
      temephos toxicity (57%). In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time in 
      insects that insecticide-induced P-gp expression can be involved in the modulation 
      of insecticide efflux.

AB  - Axon pruning during development is essential for proper wiring of the mature nervous 
      system, but its regulation remains poorly understood. We have identified an 
      immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, Plum, that is cell 
      autonomously required for axon pruning of mushroom body (MB) γ neurons and for 
      ectopic synapse refinement at the developing neuromuscular junction in Drosophila. 
      Plum promotes MB γ neuron axon pruning by regulating the expression of Ecdysone 
      Receptor-B1, a key initiator of axon pruning. Genetic analyses indicate that Plum 
      acts to facilitate signaling of Myoglianin, a glial-derived TGF-β, on MB γ neurons 
      upstream of the type-I TGF-β receptor Baboon. Myoglianin, Baboon, and Ecdysone 
      Receptor-B1 are also required for neuromuscular junction ectopic synapse refinement. 
      Our study highlights both IgSF proteins and TGF-β facilitation as key promoters of 
      developmental axon elimination and demonstrates a mechanistic conservation between 
      MB axon pruning during metamorphosis and the refinement of ectopic larval 
      neuromuscular connections.

TI  - A single amino acid polymorphism in ABCC2 loop 1 is responsible for differential

      species.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins exert their toxicity by forming membrane pores 
      after binding with larval midgut membrane proteins known as receptors. Spodoptera 
      litura and Spodoptera frugiperda belong to the same genus, but S. litura is tolerant 
      to Cry1Ac, while S. frugiperda is susceptible. The mechanism involved in the 
      differential toxicity of Cry1Ac to these insect species is not understood. Amino 
      acid sequences analysis of ABCC2, a well-recognized Cry1Ac receptor, from both 
      species showed high sequence identity. Hi5 insect cells expressing SfABCC2 from S. 
      frugiperda were 65-fold more susceptible than those expressing the SlABCC2 from S. 
      litura. Substitution of fragments, point mutations and deletions between the ABCC2 
      of the two species revealed that ABCC2 amino acid Q(125) from SfABCC2 or E(125) from 
      SlABCC2 was key factor for the differential Cry1Ac toxicity to Hi5 cells expressing 
      these receptors. Consistently with this, cells expressing Helicoverpa armigera 
      HaABCC2(Q122)-GFP, were more susceptible to Cry1Ac than cells expressing 
      HaABCC2(E122)-GFP mutant. Q(125) or E(125) is located in a predicted exposed loop 1 
      region of ABCC2 indicating that this region could be important for Cry1Ac binding. 
      These findings identified a single amino acid residue located in loop 1 of ABCC2 
      transporter as responsible for the different levels of susceptibility to Cry1Ac 
      among various lepidopteran species.

AB  - Accurate determination of potential drug-drug interaction mediated by efflux 
      transporters (tDDI) is crucial to assess the risk of pharmacokinetic interaction and 
      toxicity of drugs. Passive permeability and uptake transporter mediated transport 
      are important covariates of cell-based inhibition assays that need to be taken into 
      consideration when performing kinetic analysis of data. Vesicular uptake inhibition 
      has been considered by regulatory agencies as a viable alternative for testing tDDI 
      potential of low passive permeability drugs in particular. Membranes prepared from a 
      P-gp overexpressing human cell line has superior transport properties over membranes 
      prepared from Sf9 cells and cholesterol enriched Sf9 membranes. P-gp expressed in 
      this membrane effluxes N-methyl-quinidine (NMQ) with high affinity (K(m) is 3.65 μM) 
      and a high rate (V(max) is 656 pmol/mg protein/min). Digoxin, vinblastine and 
      paclitaxel, established P-gp substrates inhibited transport of NMQ with estimated 
      K(i) values of 250, 0.1 and 0.6 μM, respectively. A panel of 11 drugs that have been 
      listed by regulatory agencies as reference inhibitors were used to validate the 
      assay to predict clinical inhibition potential. All the drugs that have been 
      implicated in P-gp mediated DDI were found to be inhibitors in a relevant 
      concentration range.

AB  - When ribosomes encounter mRNAs lacking stop codons, two quality-control machineries, 
      NSD for nonstop mRNA decay and ribosome quality control (RQC) for co-translational 
      degradation of the nonstop protein by the proteasome, are triggered to eliminate 
      aberrant molecules. In yeast, it is known that Dom34 (a homolog of eRF1) and Ltn1 
      (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) play crucial roles in NSD and RQC, respectively, by 
      triggering ribosome rescue at the 3' end of nonstop mRNAs and proteasome-dependent 
      polypeptide degradation. Here we confirmed the essential role of Ltn1 in RQC for 
      nonstop products in Drosophila cells, and further uncovered a functional role of 
      ABCE1, a eukaryotic ribosome recycling factor, in NSD in Drosophila cells.

TI  - Selectivity in the Efflux of Glucuronides by Human Transporters: MRP4 Is Highly 
      Active toward 4-Methylumbelliferone and 1-Naphthol Glucuronides, while MRP3 Exhibits 
      Stereoselective Propranolol Glucuronide Transport.
PG  - 3299-3311
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00366 [doi]
AB  - Xenobiotic and endobiotic glucuronides, which are generated in hepatic and 
      intestinal epithelial cells, are excreted via efflux transporters. Multidrug 
      resistance proteins 2-4 (MRP2-MRP4) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
      are efflux transporters that are expressed in these polarized cells, on either the 
      basolateral or apical membranes. Their localization, along with expression levels, 
      affects the glucuronide excretion pathways. We have studied the transport of three 
      planar cyclic glucuronides and glucuronides of the two propranolol enantiomers, by 
      the vesicular transport assay, using vesicles from baculovirus-infected insect cells 
      expressing human MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, or BCRP. The transport of 
      estradiol-17β-glucuronide by recombinant MRP2-4 and BCRP, as demonstrated by kinetic 
      values, were within the ranges previously reported. Our results revealed high 
      transport rates and apparent affinity of MRP4 toward the glucuronides of 
      4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, and 1-hydroxypyrene (K(m) values of 168, 13, and 
      3 μM, respectively) in comparison to MRP3 (K(m) values of 278, 98, and 8 μM, 
      respectively). MRP3 exhibited lower rates, but stereoselective transport of 
      propranolol glucuronides, with higher affinity toward the R-enantiomer than the 
      S-enantiomer (K(m) values 154 vs 434 μM). The glucuronide of propranolol 
      R-enantiomer was not significantly transported by either MRP2, MRP4, or BCRP. Of the 
      tested small glucuronides in this study, BCRP transported only 1-hydroxypyrene 
      glucuronide, at very high rates and high apparent affinity (V(max) and K(m) values 
      of 4400 pmol/mg/min and 11 μM). The transport activity of MRP2 with all of the 
      studied small glucuronides was relatively very low, even though it transported the 
      reference compound, estradiol-17β-glucuronide, at a high rate (V(max) = 3500 
      pmol/mg/min). Our results provide new information, at the molecular level, of efflux 
      transport of the tested glucuronides, which could explain their disposition in vivo, 
      as well as provide new tools for in vitro studies of MRP3, MRP4, and BCRP.

TI  - The multidrug resistance transporters CgTpo1_1 and CgTpo1_2 play a role in virulence 
      and biofilm formation in the human pathogen Candida glabrata.
LID - 10.1111/cmi.12686 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms of persistence and virulence associated with Candida glabrata 
      infections are poorly understood, limiting the ability to fight this fungal 
      pathogen. In this study, the multidrug resistance transporters CgTpo1_1 and CgTpo1_2 
      are shown to play a role in C. glabrata virulence. The survival of the infection 
      model Galleria mellonella, infected with C. glabrata, was found to increase upon the 
      deletion of either CgTPO1_1 or CgTPO1_2. The underlying mechanisms were further 
      explored. In the case of CgTpo1_1, this phenotype was found to be consistent with 
      the observation that it confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMP), such as 
      the human AMP histatin-5. The deletion of CgTPO1_2, on the other hand, was found to 
      limit the survival of C. glabrata cells when exposed to phagocytosis and impair 
      biofilm formation. Interestingly, CgTPO1_2 expression was found to be up-regulated 
      during biofilm formation, but and its deletion leads to a decreased expression of 
      adhesin-encoding genes during biofilm formation, which is consistent with a role in 
      biofilm formation. CgTPO1_2 expression was further seen to decrease plasma membrane 
      potential and affect ergosterol and fatty acid content. Altogether, CgTpo1_1 and 
      CgTpo1_2 appear to play an important role in the virulence of C. glabrata 
      infections, being at the cross-road between multidrug resistance and pathogenesis.

TI  - Insights into the Structure of the Spruce Budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) Genome, 
      as Revealed by Molecular Cytogenetic Analyses and a High-Density Linkage Map.
PG  - 2539-2549
LID - 10.1534/g3.118.200263 [doi]
AB  - Genome structure characterization can contribute to a better understanding of 
      processes such as adaptation, speciation, and karyotype evolution, and can provide 
      useful information for refining genome assemblies. We studied the genome of an 
      important North American boreal forest pest, the spruce budworm, Choristoneura 
      fumiferana, through a combination of molecular cytogenetic analyses and construction 
      of a high-density linkage map based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers 
      obtained through a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. Cytogenetic analyses 
      using fluorescence in situ hybridization methods confirmed the haploid chromosome 
      number of n = 30 in both sexes of C. fumiferana and showed, for the first time, that 
      this species has a WZ/ZZ sex chromosome system. Synteny analysis based on a 
      comparison of the Bombyx mori genome and the C. fumiferana linkage map revealed the 
      presence of a neo-Z chromosome in the latter species, as previously reported for 
      other tortricid moths. In this neo-Z chromosome, we detected an ABC transporter C2 
      (ABCC2) gene that has been associated with insecticide resistance. Sex-linkage of 
      the ABCC2 gene provides a genomic context favorable to selection and rapid spread of 
      resistance against Bacillus thuringiensis serotype kurstaki (Btk), the main 
      insecticide used in Canada to control spruce budworm populations. Ultimately, the 
      linkage map we developed, which comprises 3586 SNP markers distributed over 30 
      linkage groups for a total length of 1720.41 cM, will be a valuable tool for 
      refining our draft assembly of the spruce budworm genome.

AB  - Information about the receptor-interaction region of Cry toxins, insecticidal 
      proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, is needed to elucidate the mode of 
      action of Cry toxins and improve their toxicity through protein engineering. We 
      analyzed the interaction sites on Cry1Aa with ABC transporter C2 (ABCC2), one of the 
      most important Cry1A toxin receptors. A competitive binding assay revealed that the 
      Bombyx mori ABCC2 (BmABCC2) Cry1A binding site was the same as the BtR175 binding 
      site, suggesting that the loop region of Cry1Aa domain II is a binding site. Next, 
      we constructed several domain II loop mutant toxins and tested their binding 
      affinity in an SPR analysis, and also performed a cell swelling assay to evaluate 
      receptor-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that the loop regions required 
      for BtR175 and BmABCC2 binding and the regions important for cytotoxicity partially 
      overlap. Our results also suggest that receptor binding is necessary but not 
      sufficient for cytotoxicity. This is the first report showing the region of 
      interaction between ABCC2 and Cry1Aa and the cytotoxicity-relevant properties of the 
      Cry1Aa domain II loop region.

TI  - Hepatocellular organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and multidrug 
      resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are inhibited by silibinin.
PG  - 1522-8
LID - 10.1124/dmd.113.051037 [doi]
AB  - Silibinin has been reported to be a promising compound for hepatitis C treatment of 
      nonresponders to standard treatment. Although administered silibinin is well 
      tolerated, increased serum bilirubin levels have been observed during high-dose i.v. 
      silibinin therapy. The mechanism of silibinin-induced hyperbilirubinemia in humans, 
      however, has not been identified so far. The aim of this study was to investigate 
      the effect of silibinin on hepatocellular uptake and efflux transport systems for 
      organic anions to elucidate the cause of silibinin-induced hyperbilirubinemia. 
      Therefore, the effect of silibinin on transport activity of the hepatocellular 
      uptake transporters organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) OATP1B1, 
      OATP1B3, and OATP2B1, as well as Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide 
      (NTCP) and of the efflux transporters multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 
      (MRP2) and bile-salt export pump (BSEP) was studied. The effect of silibinin on 
      OATPs and NTCP function was studied in stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary 
      cells using the radiolabeled model substrates estrone-3-sulfate and 
      dehydroepiandrosteronesulfate for OATPs and taurocholate for NTCP. Interaction of 
      silibinin with MRP2 and BSEP was measured in vesicles isolated from Sf21 or Sf9 
      insect cells expressing these transporters using either estradiol-17β-glucuronide or 
      taurocholate as substrates. OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1 were inhibited by 
      silibinin, with OATP1B1 being inhibited by (a) complex mechanism(s). An inhibitory 
      effect was also seen for MRP2. In contrast, the bile acid transporters NTCP and BSEP 
      were not affected by silibinin. We concluded that silibinin-induced 
      hyperbilirubinemia may be caused by an inhibition of the bilirubin-transporting 
      OATPs and the efflux-transporter MRP2.

AB  - P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1) is an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter that is 
      associated with the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Pgp 
      transports a variety of chemically dissimilar amphipathic compounds using the energy 
      from ATP hydrolysis. In the present study, to elucidate the binding sites on Pgp for 
      substrates and modulators, we employed site-directed mutagenesis, cell- and 
      membrane-based assays, molecular modeling and docking. We generated single, double 
      and triple mutants with substitutions of the Y307, F343, Q725, F728, F978 and V982 
      residues at the proposed drug-binding site with cys in a cysless Pgp, and expressed 
      them in insect and mammalian cells using a baculovirus expression system. All the 
      mutant proteins were expressed at the cell surface to the same extent as the cysless 
      wild-type Pgp. With substitution of three residues of the pocket (Y307, Q725 and 
      V982) with cysteine in a cysless Pgp, QZ59S-SSS, cyclosporine A, tariquidar, 
      valinomycin and FSBA lose the ability to inhibit the labeling of Pgp with a 
      transport substrate, [(125)I]-Iodoarylazidoprazosin, indicating these drugs cannot 
      bind at their primary binding sites. However, the drugs can modulate the ATP 
      hydrolysis of the mutant Pgps, demonstrating that they bind at secondary sites. In 
      addition, the transport of six fluorescent substrates in HeLa cells expressing 
      triple mutant (Y307C/Q725C/V982C) Pgp is also not significantly altered, showing 
      that substrates bound at secondary sites are still transported. The homology 
      modeling of human Pgp and substrate and modulator docking studies support the 
      biochemical and transport data. In aggregate, our results demonstrate that a large 
      flexible pocket in the Pgp transmembrane domains is able to bind chemically diverse 
      compounds. When residues of the primary drug-binding site are mutated, substrates 
      and modulators bind to secondary sites on the transporter and more than one 
      transport-active binding site is available for each substrate.

PG  - 715-21
LID - 10.1534/genetics.113.156737 [doi]
AB  - We report a simple yet extremely efficient platform for systematic gene targeting by 
      the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 in Drosophila. The system comprises two transgenic 
      strains: one expressing Cas9 protein from the germline-specific nanos promoter and 
      the other ubiquitously expressing a custom guide RNA (gRNA) that targets a unique 
      site in the genome. The two strains are crossed to form an active Cas9-gRNA complex 
      specifically in germ cells, which cleaves and mutates the target site. We 
      demonstrate rapid generation of mutants in seven neuropeptide and two microRNA genes 
      in which no mutants have been described. Founder animals stably expressing Cas9-gRNA 
      transmitted germline mutations to an average of 60% of their progeny, a dramatic 
      improvement in efficiency over the previous methods based on transient Cas9 
      expression. Simultaneous cleavage of two sites by co-expression of two gRNAs 
      efficiently induced internal deletion with frequencies of 4.3-23%. Our method is 
      readily scalable to high-throughput gene targeting, thereby accelerating 
      comprehensive functional annotation of the Drosophila genome.

TI  - Mitochondrial P-glycoprotein ATPase contributes to insecticide resistance in the 
      cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera).
PG  - 651-60
LID - 10.1007/s12013-014-9969-5 [doi]
AB  - Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is one of the most damaging polyphagous pests 
      worldwide, which has developed high levels of resistance to commonly applied 
      insecticides. Mitochondrial P-glycoprotein (Pgp) was detected in the 
      insecticide-resistant strain of H. armigera using C219 antibodies, and its possible 
      role was demonstrated in the efflux of xenobiotic compounds using 
      spectrofluorometer. The TMR accumulated in mitochondria in the absence of ATP, and 
      effluxed out in presence of ATP; the process of efflux was inhibited in the presence 
      of ortho-vandate, an inhibitor of Pgp, in insecticide-resistant larvae of H. 
      armigera. The mitochondria isolated from insecticide-resistant larvae were resistant 
      to insecticide-induced inhibition of oxygen consumption and cytochrome c release. 
      Membrane potential decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of higher 
      concentration of insecticides (>50 µM) in mitochondria of insecticide-resistant 
      larvae. In conclusion, mitochondrial Pgp ATPase detected in the 
      insecticide-resistant larvae influenced the efflux of xenobiotic compounds. Pgp 
      might be involved in protecting the mitochondrial DNA and the components of the 
      electron transport chain from damage due to insecticides, and contributing to the 
      resistance to the deleterious effects of insecticides on the growth of 
      insecticide-resistant H. armigera larvae.

TI  - Genetic knockdown of a single organic anion transporter alters the expression of 
      functionally related genes in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 2601-10
LID - 10.1242/jeb.071100 [doi]
AB  - Insects excrete a wide variety of toxins via the Malpighian (renal) tubules. 
      Previous studies have implicated three transporters in the secretion of the organic 
      anion (OA) methotrexate (MTX) by the Drosophila Malpighian tubule: Drosophila 
      multidrug resistance-associated protein (dMRP, CG6214), a multidrug efflux 
      transporter (MET, CG30344), and an organic anion transporting polypeptide 58Dc 
      (OATP58Dc, CG3380). RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown and P-element insertion 
      mutation of single OA transporter genes were used to evaluate the importance of 
      these three putative transporters in the secretion of MTX by the Malpighian tubules 
      of Drosophila melanogaster. A major finding is that genetic knockdown of a single OA 
      transporter gene leads to reductions in the expression of at least one other OA 
      transporter gene and in secretion of MTX by Malpighian tubules isolated from flies 
      reared on a standard diet. The pattern of changes indicates that decreases in MTX 
      secretion do not correspond to decreases in dMRP expression in all of the RNAi 
      lines. Genetic knockdown of a single OA transporter gene also alters the extent of 
      upregulation of multiple OA transporter genes in the tubules in response to dietary 
      MTX. Knockdown of dMRP is associated with a decrease in MET expression but an 
      increase in OATP expression when flies are reared on MTX-enriched diet. Our results 
      indicate that dMRP and MET are not the dominant MTX transporters in the tubules when 
      flies are reared on MTX-enriched diets. At least one additional transporter, and 
      possibly OATP, are required for MTX secretion. The implications of our results for 
      studies using genetic knockdown techniques to identify OA transporters in whole 
      tissues such as Malpighian tubules are discussed.

AB  - The way in which light is polarized when reflected from leaves can be affected by 
      infection with plant viruses. This has the potential to influence viral transmission 
      by insect vectors due to altered visual attractiveness of infected plants. The 
      optical and topological properties of cuticular waxes and trichomes are important 
      determinants of how light is polarized upon reflection. Changes in expression of 
      genes involved in the formation of surface structures have also been reported 
      following viral infection. This paper investigates the role of altered surface 
      structures in virus-induced changes to polarization reflection from leaves. The 
      percentage polarization of reflections from Arabidopsis thaliana cer5, cer6 and cer8 
      wax synthesis mutants, and the gl1 leaf hair mutant, was compared to those from 
      wild-type (WT) leaves. The cer5 mutant leaves were less polarizing than WT on the 
      adaxial and abaxial surfaces; gl1 leaves were more polarizing than WT on the adaxial 
      surfaces. The cer6 and cer8 mutations did not significantly affect polarization 
      reflection. The impacts of Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV) infection on the 
      polarization of reflected light were significantly affected by cer5 mutation, with 
      the reflections from cer5 mutants being higher than those from WT leaves, suggesting 
      that changes in CER5 expression following infection could influence the polarization 
      of the reflections. There was, however, no significant effect of the gl1 mutation on 
      polarization following TVCV infection. The cer5 and gl1 mutations did not affect the 
      changes in polarization following Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection. The 
      accumulation of TVCV and CMV did not differ significantly between mutant and WT 
      leaves, suggesting that altered expression of surface structure genes does not 
      significantly affect viral titres, raising the possibility that if such regulatory 
      changes have any adaptive value it may possibly be through impacts on viral 
      transmission.

TI  - Increased Expression of P-Glycoprotein Is Associated With Chlorpyrifos Resistance in 
      the German Cockroach (Blattodea: Blattellidae).
PG  - 2500-2505
LID - 10.1093/jee/tow141 [doi]
AB  - A principal method for control of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), is 
      the broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide, chlorpyrifos (O,O-diethyl 
      O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothioate); however, extensive and repeated 
      application has resulted in the development of resistance to chlorpyrifos in this 
      insect. Evidence suggests that ATP-binding cassette protein transporters, including 
      P-glycoprotein, are involved in insecticide resistance. However, little is known of 
      the role of P-glycoprotein in insecticide resistance in the German cockroach. Here, 
      we developed a chlorpyrifos-resistant strain of German cockroach and investigated 
      the relationship between P-glycoprotein and chlorpyrifos resistance using toxicity 
      assays; inhibition studies with two P-glycoprotein inhibitors, verapamil and 
      quinine; P-glycoprotein-ATPase activity assays; and western blotting analysis. After 
      23 generations of selection from susceptible strain cockroaches, we obtained animals 
      with high resistance to chlorpyrifos. When P-glycoprotein-ATPase activity was 
      inhibited by verapamil and quinine, we observed enhanced susceptibility to 
      chlorpyrifos in both control and chlorpyrifos-resistant cockroaches. No significant 
      alterations of P-glycoprotein expression or ATPase activity were observed in 
      cockroaches acutely exposed to LD50 doses of chlorpyrifos for 24 h, while 
      P-glycoprotein expression and ATPase activity were clearly elevated in the 
      chlorpyrifos-resistant cockroach strain. Thus, we conclude that P-glycoprotein is 
      associated with chlorpyrifos resistance in the German cockroach and that elevated 
      levels of P-glycoprotein expression and ATPase activity may be an important 
      mechanism of chlorpyrifos resistance in the German cockroach.

AB  - SummaryA single gene might have several functions within an organism, and so 
      mutational loss of that gene has multiple effects across different physiological 
      systems in the organism. Though the white gene in Drosophila melanogaster was 
      identified originally for its effect on fly eye color, an article by Xiao and 
      Robertson in the June 2016 issue of GENETICS describes a function for the white gene 
      in the response of Drosophila to oxygen deprivation. This Primer article provides 
      background information on the white gene, the phenomenon of pleiotropy, and the 
      molecular and genetic approaches used in the study to demonstrate a new behavioral 
      function for the white gene.

TI  - Overexpression of a cytochrome P450 and a UDP-glycosyltransferase is associated with 
      imidacloprid resistance in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata.

AB  - Current control of insect pests relies on chemical insecticides, however, 
      insecticide resistance development by pests is a growing concern in pest management. 
      The main mechanisms for insecticide resistance typically involve elevated activity 
      of detoxifying enzymes and xenobiotic transporters that break-down and excrete 
      insecticide molecules. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of 
      imidacloprid resistance in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata 
      (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), an insect pest notorious for its capacity to 
      develop insecticide resistance rapidly. We compared the transcriptome profiles of 
      imidacloprid-resistant and sensitive beetle strains and identified 102 
      differentially expressed transcripts encoding detoxifying enzymes and xenobiotic 
      transporters. Of these, 74 were up-regulated and 28 were down-regulated in the 
      resistant strain. We then used RNA interference to knock down the transcript levels 
      of seven up-regulated genes in the resistant beetles. Ingestion of double-stranded 
      RNA successfully knocked down the expression of the genes for three cytochrome P450s 
      (CYP6BQ15, CYP4Q3 and CYP4Q7), one ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter (ABC-G), 
      one esterase (EST1), and two UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGT1 and UGT2). Further, we 
      demonstrated that silencing of CYP4Q3 and UGT2 significantly increased 
      susceptibility of resistant beetles to imidacloprid, indicating that overexpression 
      of these two genes contributes to imidacloprid resistance in this resistant strain.

TI  - The maize b1 paramutation control region causes epigenetic silencing in Drosophila 
      melanogaster.
PG  - 591-606
LID - 10.1007/s00438-012-0702-z [doi]
AB  - Paramutation is an epigenetic process in which a combination of alleles in a 
      heterozygous organism results in a meiotically stable change in expression of one of 
      the alleles. The mechanisms underlying paramutation are being actively investigated, 
      and examples have been described in both plants and mammals, suggesting that it may 
      utilize epigenetic mechanisms that are widespread and evolutionarily conserved. 
      Paramutation at the well-studied maize b1 locus requires a control region consisting 
      of seven 853 bp tandem repeats. To study the conservation of the epigenetic 
      mechanisms underlying seemingly unique epigenetic processes such as paramutation, we 
      created transgenic Drosophila melanogaster carrying the maize b1 control region 
      adjacent to the Drosophila white reporter gene. We show that the b1 tandem repeats 
      cause silencing of the white reporter in Drosophila. A single copy of the tandem 
      repeat sequence is sufficient to cause silencing, and silencing strength increases 
      as the number of tandem repeats increases. Additionally, transgenic lines with the 
      full seven tandem repeats demonstrate evidence of either pairing-sensitive silencing 
      and silencing in trans, or epigenetic activation in trans. These trans-interactions 
      are dependent on repeat number, similar to maize b1 paramutation. Also, as in maize, 
      the tandem repeats are bidirectionally transcribed in Drosophila. These results 
      indicate that the maize b1 tandem repeats function as an epigenetic silencer and 
      mediate trans-interactions in Drosophila, and support the hypothesis that the 
      mechanisms underlying such epigenetic processes are conserved.

TI  - Human-Mouse Chimeras with Normal Expression and Function Reveal That Major Domain 
      Swapping Is Tolerated by P-Glycoprotein (ABCB1).
PG  - 1010-23
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01064 [doi]
AB  - The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays a vital role in the transport of 
      molecules across cell membranes and has been shown to interact with a panoply of 
      functionally and structurally unrelated compounds. How human P-gp interacts with 
      this large number of drugs has not been well understood, although structural 
      flexibility has been implicated. To gain insight into this transporter's broad 
      substrate specificity and to assess its ability to accommodate a variety of 
      molecular and structural changes, we generated human-mouse P-gp chimeras by the 
      exchange of homologous transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains. High-level 
      expression of these chimeras by BacMam- and baculovirus-mediated transduction in 
      mammalian (HeLa) and insect cells, respectively, was achieved. There were no 
      detectable differences between wild-type and chimeric P-gp in terms of cell surface 
      expression, ability to efflux the P-gp substrates rhodamine 123, calcein-AM, and 
      JC-1, or to be inhibited by the substrate cyclosporine A and the inhibitors 
      tariquidar and elacridar. Additionally, expression of chimeric P-gp was able to 
      confer a paclitaxel-resistant phenotype to HeLa cells characteristic of 
      P-gp-mediated drug resistance. P-gp ATPase assays and photo-cross-linking with 
      [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin confirmed that transport and biochemical properties of 
      P-gp chimeras were similar to those of wild-type P-gp, although differences in drug 
      binding were detected when human and mouse transmembrane domains were combined. 
      Overall, chimeras with one or two mouse P-gp domains were deemed functionally 
      equivalent to human wild-type P-gp, demonstrating the ability of human P-gp to 
      tolerate major structural changes.

AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) exists in animals, fungi and bacteria and likely evolved as a 
      defense mechanism against harmful substances. Here a cDNA (4054bp) encoding a 
      putative P-glycoprotein gene from Helicoverpa armigera was cloned and named HaPgp1. 
      This putative HaPgp1 sequence encoded a protein of 1253 amino acids with a molecular 
      mass of approximately 137kDa. qPCR analyses demonstrated that the expression of 
      HaPgp1 was significantly higher in 4th instar larvae when compared to other 
      developmental stages. HaPgp1 transcripts were more abundant in the head and fat 
      bodies than in other tissues. Compared with the control, the expression of HaPgp1 
      reach a peak at 12h after the treatment by 2-tridecanone in all tissues. However, 
      the expression of HaPgp1 increased from 12h to 48h after treatment with abamectin in 
      all tissues. Immunohistochemistry analyses also verified that 2-tridecanone and 
      abamectin can induce the increase of HaPgp1 expression. RNAi of HaPgp1 significantly 
      raised the mortality rate of larvae treated by 2-tridecanone and abamectin, as 
      compared to control larvae fed with GFP dsRNA. These results illustrate the possible 
      involvement of HaPgp1 as a component of the protective mechanisms to plant secondary 
      chemicals such as 2-tridecanone and to certain classes of insecticides, like 
      abamectin.

AB  - The coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei, is the most economically important 
      insect pest of coffee worldwide. We present an analysis of the draft genome of the 
      coffee berry borer, the third genome for a Coleopteran species. The genome size is 
      ca. 163 Mb with 19,222 predicted protein-coding genes. Analysis was focused on genes 
      involved in primary digestion as well as gene families involved in detoxification of 
      plant defense molecules and insecticides, such as carboxylesterases, cytochrome 
      P450, gluthathione S-transferases, ATP-binding cassette transporters, and a gene 
      that confers resistance to the insecticide dieldrin. A broad range of enzymes 
      capable of degrading complex polysaccharides were identified. We also evaluated the 
      pathogen defense system and found homologs to antimicrobial genes reported in the 
      Drosophila genome. Ten cases of horizontal gene transfer were identified with 
      evidence for expression, integration into the H. hampei genome, and phylogenetic 
      evidence that the sequences are more closely related to bacterial rather than 
      eukaryotic genes. The draft genome analysis broadly expands our knowledge on the 
      biology of a devastating tropical insect pest and suggests new pest management 
      strategies.

TI  - The Effects and Mechanisms of Periplaneta americana Extract Reversal of Multi-Drug 
      Resistance in BEL-7402/5-FU Cells.
LID - 10.3390/molecules21070852 [doi]
LID - 852
AB  - The present study reports the reversing effects of extracts from P. americana on 
      multidrug resistance of BEL-7402/5-FU cells, as well as a preliminary investigation 
      on their mechanism of action. A methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method was applied 
      to determine the multidrug resistance of BEL-7402/5-FU, while an intracellular drug 
      accumulation assay was used to evaluate the effects of a column chromatography 
      extract (PACC) and defatted extract (PADF) from P. americana on reversing multi-drug 
      resistance. BEL-7402/5-FU reflected high resistance to 5-FU; PACC and PADF could 
      promote drug accumulation in BEL-7402/5-FU cells, among which PADF was more 
      effective than PACC. Moreover, results from the immunocytochemical method showed 
      that PACC and PADF could downregulate the expression of drug resistance-associated 
      proteins (P-gp, MRP, LRP); PACC and PADF had no effects on the expression of 
      multidrug resistance-associated enzymes (GST-π), but PACC could increase the 
      expression of multidrug resistance-associated enzymes (PKC). Results of real-time 
      fluorescence quantitative PCR revealed that PACC and PADF were able to markedly 
      inhibit the expression of multidrug resistance-associated genes (MDR1, LRP and 
      MRP1); PACC presented a significant impact on the gene expression of multidrug 
      resistance-associated enzymes, which increased the gene expression of GST-π and PKC. 
      However, PADF had little impact on the expression of multidrug resistance-associated 
      enzymes. These results demonstrated that PACC and PADF extracted from P. americana 
      could effectively reverse MDR in BEL-7402/5-FU cells, whose mechanism was to inhibit 
      the expression of P-gp, MRP, and LRP, and that PADF was more effective in the 
      reversal of MDR than did PACC. In addition, some of extracts from P. americana 
      altered (sometimes increasing) the expression of multidrug resistance-associated 
      enzymes.

AB  - The use of Bt proteins in crops has revolutionized insect pest management by 
      offering effective season-long control. However, field-evolved resistance to Bt 
      proteins threatens their utility and durability. A recent example is field-evolved 
      resistance to Cry1Fa and Cry1A.105 in fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). This 
      resistance has been detected in Puerto Rico, mainland USA, and Brazil. A S. 
      frugiperda population with suspected resistance to Cry1Fa was sampled from a maize 
      field in Puerto Rico and used to develop a resistant lab colony. The colony 
      demonstrated resistance to Cry1Fa and partial cross-resistance to Cry1A.105 in diet 
      bioassays. Using genetic crosses and proteomics, we show that this resistance is due 
      to loss-of-function mutations in the ABCC2 gene. We characterize two novel mutant 
      alleles from Puerto Rico. We also find that these alleles are absent in a broad 
      screen of partially resistant Brazilian populations. These findings confirm that 
      ABCC2 is a receptor for Cry1Fa and Cry1A.105 in S. frugiperda, and lay the 
      groundwork for genetically enabled resistance management in this species, with the 
      caution that there may be several distinct ABCC2 resistances alleles in nature.

AB  - Macrocyclic lactones such as abamectin and ivermectin constitute an important class 
      of broad-spectrum insecticides. Widespread resistance to synthetic insecticides, 
      including abamectin and ivermectin, poses a serious threat to the management of 
      diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a major pest 
      of cruciferous plants worldwide. P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of the ABC 
      transporter superfamily, plays a crucial role in the removal of amphiphilic 
      xenobiotics, suggesting a mechanism for drug resistance in target organisms. In this 
      study, PxPgp1, a putative Pgp gene from P. xylostella, was cloned and characterized. 
      The open reading frame (ORF) of PxPgp1 consists of 3774 nucleotides, which encodes a 
      1257-amino acid peptide. The deduced PxPgp1 protein possesses structural 
      characteristics of a typical Pgp, and clusters within the insect ABCB1. PxPgp1 was 
      expressed throughout all developmental stages, and showed the highest expression 
      level in adult males. PxPgp1 was highly expressed in midgut, malpighian tubules and 
      testes. Elevated expression of PxPgp1 was observed in P. xylostella strains after 
      they were exposed to the abamectin treatment. In addition, the constitutive 
      expressions of PxPgp1 were significantly higher in laboratory-selected and 
      field-collected resistant strains in comparison to their susceptible counterpart.

TI  - Modulation of the ATPase and transport activities of broad-acting multidrug 
      resistance factor ABCC10 (MRP7).
PG  - 6457-67
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1340 [doi]
AB  - The cell surface molecule ABCC10 is a broad-acting transporter of xenobiotics, 
      including cancer drugs, such as taxanes, epothilone B, and modulators of the 
      estrogen pathway. Abcc10(-/-) mice exhibit increased tissue sensitivity and 
      lethality resulting from paclitaxel exposure compared with wild-type counterparts, 
      arguing ABCC10 functions as a major determinant of taxane sensitivity in mice. To 
      better understand the mechanistic basis of ABCC10 action, we characterized the 
      biochemical and vectorial transport properties of this protein. Using crude 
      membranes in an ABCC10 overexpression system, we found that the ABCC10 transport 
      substrates estrogen estradiol-glucuronide (E(2)17βG) and leukotriene C4 (LTC(4)) 
      significantly stimulated ABCC10 beryllium fluoride (BeFx)-sensitive ATPase activity. 
      We also defined the E(2)17βG antagonist, tamoxifen, as a novel substrate and 
      stimulator of ABCC10. In addition, a number of cytotoxic substrates, including 
      docetaxel, paclitaxel, and Ara-C, increased the ABCC10 basal ATPase activity. We 
      determined that ABCC10 localizes to the basolateral cell surface, using 
      transepithelial well assays to establish that ABCC10-overexpressing LLC-PK1 cells 
      exported [(3)H]-docetaxel from the apical to the basolateral side. Importantly, we 
      found that the clinically valuable multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, and a natural 
      alkaloid, cepharanthine, inhibited ABCC10 docetaxel transport activity. Thus, 
      concomitant use of these agents might restore the intracellular accumulation and 
      potency of ABCC10-exported cytotoxic drugs, such as paclitaxel. Overall, our work 
      could seed future efforts to identify inhibitors and other physiologic substrates of 
      ABCC10.

TI  - Construction of a simple evaluation system for the intestinal absorption of an 
      orally administered medicine using Bombyx mori larvae.
PG  - 7-15
LID - 10.5582/ddt.2018.01004 [doi]
AB  - Human intestinal absorption is estimated using a human colon carcinoma cell line 
      (Caco-2) cells from human colorectal adenocarcinoma, intestinal perfusion, or a 
      mammalian model. These current evaluation systems are limited in their ability to 
      estimate human intestinal absorption. In addition, in vivo evaluation systems using 
      laboratory animals such as mice and rats entail animal ethics problems, and it is 
      difficult to screen compounds on a large scale at the drug discovery stage. Thus, we 
      propose the use of Bombyx mori larvae for evaluation of intestinal absorption of 
      compounds as an alternative system in this study. First, to compare the 
      characteristics among Caco-2 cells, human intestine, and B. mori larval midgut, we 
      analyzed their RNA-seq data, and we found 26 drug transporters common to humans and 
      B. mori. Next, we quantitatively developed an oral administration technique in B. 
      mori and established a method using silkworm B. mori larvae that can easily estimate 
      the intestinal permeability of compounds. Consequently, we could determine the dose 
      and technique for oral administration in B. mori larvae. We also developed a B. mori 
      model to evaluate the intestinal permeability of orally administered. Our 
      constructed evaluation system will be useful for evaluating intestinal permeability 
      in medical drug development.

AB  - 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World 
      Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted in 
      resistance, and with continued use resistance will increase in terms of level and 
      extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran that has many available genetic 
      tools, numerous studies done on insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is related to 
      malaria mosquitoes allowing for extrapolation. The 91-R strain of D. melanogaster is 
      highly resistant to DDT (>1500-fold), however, there is no mechanistic scheme that 
      accounts for this level of resistance. Recently, reduced penetration, increased 
      detoxification, and direct excretion have been identified as resistance mechanisms 
      in the 91-R strain. Their interactions, however, remain unclear. Use of UAS-RNAi 
      transgenic lines of D. melanogaster allowed for the targeted knockdown of genes 
      putatively involved in DDT resistance and has validated the role of several 
      cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and 
      Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette transporters (Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved in 
      DDT resistance. Further, increased sensitivity to DDT in the 91-R strain after 
      intra-abdominal dsRNA injection for Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1 was determined by a DDT 
      contact bioassay, directly implicating these genes in DDT efflux and resistance.

TI  - The sulfonylurea receptor Sur is dispensable for chitin synthesis in Drosophila 
      melanogaster embryos.
PG  - 1136-40
LID - 10.1002/ps.3476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chitin produced by membrane-inserted chitin synthases is an important 
      constituent of the arthropod cuticle and midgut peritrophic matrix. Chitin synthesis 
      inhibitors are common insecticides in pest control. As the target of 
      sulfonylurea-derived insecticides such as diflubenzuron, the ABC transporter 
      sulfonylurea receptor (Sur) has been postulated to be an essential cofactor of 
      chitin synthesis. However, direct evidence for this assumption is missing. RESULTS: 
      Here, a study has been made of the phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster larvae 
      suffering completely eliminated Sur function. Taken together, it is found that 
      cuticle architecture is normal and chitin amounts are not diminished in the cuticle 
      of these animals, indicating that Sur is dispensable for chitin synthesis. 
      CONCLUSION: The data obtained suggest that there must exist another 
      sulfonylurea-sensitive ABC transporter that either instead of Sur is the true 
      sulfonylurea-sensitive transporter involved in chitin synthesis or is able to 
      substitute Sur function during cuticle formation. Identification and 
      characterisation of this factor is pivotal for understanding the mode of action of 
      sulfonylurea as insecticide.

TI  - Assessment of Bile Salt Export Pump (BSEP) Inhibition in Membrane Vesicles Using 
      Radioactive and LC/MS-Based Detection Methods.
PG  - 14.14.1-14.14.20
LID - 10.1002/cptx.15 [doi]
AB  - The bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11) belongs to the ATP-binding-cassette 
      superfamily of transporters and is predominately found in the liver. BSEP is an 
      efflux transporter that plays a critical role in the secretion of bile salts into 
      the bile. Inhibition of BSEP function by drugs can result in the buildup of bile 
      salts in the liver and eventually leads to cholestasis and drug-induced liver injury 
      (DILI). DILI is a major cause of withdrawal of drugs from the pharmaceutical market 
      and accounts for >50% of acute liver failures. Therefore, early detection of BSEP 
      inhibition by drugs can help to mitigate the possibility of BSEP-associated liver 
      injury. This unit describes two assays that investigate the relationship between 
      drug interference with BSEP function and liver injury using membrane vesicles 
      prepared from Hi5 insect cells transfected with human BSEP. Comprehensive protocols 
      for assessing BSEP inhibition in a 384-well format using radiolabeled and liquid 
      chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based detection methods are described. ©

AB  - To investigate the response of Plutella xylostella transcriptome in defending 
      against a Bt toxin, high-throughput RNA-sequencing was carried out to examine 
      Cry1Ac-susceptible and -resistant strains. The comparative analysis indentified over 
      2900 differentially expressed unigenes (DEUs) between these two strains. Gene 
      Ontology analysis placed these unigenes primarily into cell, cell part, organelle, 
      binding, catalytic, cellular process, metabolic process, and response to stimulus 
      categories. Based on pathway analyses, DEUs were enriched in oxidoreductase activity 
      and membrane lipid metabolic processes, and they were also significantly enriched in 
      pathways related to the metabolic and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Most of 
      the unigenes involved in the metabolic pathway were up-regulated in resistant 
      strains. Within the ABC transporter pathway, majority of the down-regulated unigenes 
      belong to ABCC2 and ABCC10, respectively, while up-regulated unigenes were mainly 
      categorized as ABCG2. Furthermore, two aminopeptidases, and four cadherins encoding 
      genes were significantly elevated as well. This study provides a transcriptome 
      foundation for the identification and functional characterization of genes involved 
      in the Bt resistance in an agriculturally important insect pest, P. xylostella.

TI  - Steroidal alkaloids and conessine from the medicinal plant Holarrhena

      multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combinations of steroidal 
      alkaloids and conessine from the Thai medicinal plant Holarrhena antidysenterica 
      with antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains possessing different 
      efflux-pump-mediated multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes in a Galleria mellonella 
      infection model. METHODS: P. aeruginosa strains with defined mutations that result 
      in the overexpression of the MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN efflux pumps, and 
      a strain with all three of these pumps deleted, were used. In vitro, the effect of 
      combinations of steroidal alkaloids and conessine with antibiotics was compared with 
      antibiotic treatment alone via MIC determination and time-kill assays. Efficacy of 
      combinations of the steroidal alkaloids and conessine with levofloxacin were 
      compared with monotherapies against infections in G. mellonella larvae by measuring 
      larval mortality and bacterial burden. RESULTS: Combination therapies of conessine 
      or steroidal alkaloids with levofloxacin enhanced bacterial inhibition in vitro and 
      restored antibiotic efficacy in vivo compared to the constituent monotherapies. 
      Neither conessine nor the steroidal alkaloids induced any detectable toxicity in G. 
      mellonella larvae. The enhanced efficacy of the combination treatments was most 
      pronounced with conessine and correlated with reduced larval burden of infecting P. 
      aeruginosa. Notably, the enhanced efficacy of conessine/levofloxacin combinations 
      was only detected in the parent strain and strains that overexpressed the MexAB-OprM 
      or MexEF-OprN efflux systems. CONCLUSIONS: Steroidal alkaloids from Holarrhena 
      antidysenterica, and particularly the principal active ingredient conessine, 
      restored levofloxacin efficacy against resistant P. aeruginosa strains possessing 
      efflux-mediated MDR phenotypes. The compounds should be investigated further as a 
      potential novel therapy.

TI  - A K(ATP) channel gene effect on sleep duration: from genome-wide association studies 
      to function in Drosophila.
PG  - 122-32
LID - 10.1038/mp.2011.142 [doi]
AB  - Humans sleep approximately a third of their lifetime. The observation that 
      individuals with either long or short sleep duration show associations with 
      metabolic syndrome and psychiatric disorders suggests that the length of sleep is 
      adaptive. Although sleep duration can be influenced by photoperiod (season) and 
      phase of entrainment (chronotype), human familial sleep disorders indicate that 
      there is a strong genetic modulation of sleep. Therefore, we conducted high-density 
      genome-wide association studies for sleep duration in seven European populations 
      (N=4251). We identified an intronic variant (rs11046205; P=3.99 × 10(-8)) in the 
      ABCC9 gene that explains ≈5% of the variation in sleep duration. An influence of 
      season and chronotype on sleep duration was solely observed in the replication 
      sample (N=5949). Meta-analysis of the associations found in a subgroup of the 
      replication sample, chosen for season of entry and chronotype, together with the 
      discovery results showed genome-wide significance. RNA interference knockdown 
      experiments of the conserved ABCC9 homologue in Drosophila neurons renders flies 
      sleepless during the first 3 h of the night. ABCC9 encodes an ATP-sensitive 
      potassium channel subunit (SUR2), serving as a sensor of intracellular energy 
      metabolism.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics of various important drugs are known to be significantly 
      influenced by the human ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may lead to 
      clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. In contrast to therapeutic drugs, 
      emerging drugs of abuse (DOA) are sold and consumed without any safety pharmacology 
      testing. Only some studies on their metabolism were published, but none about their 
      affinity to the transporter systems. Therefore, 47 DOAs from various classes were 
      tested for their P-gp affinity using human P-gp (hP-gp) to predict possible 
      drug-drug interactions. DOAs were initially screened for general hP-gp affinity and 
      further characterized by modeling classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics and assessing 
      their K(m) and V(max) values. Among the tested drugs, 12 showed a stimulation of 
      ATPase activity. The most intensive stimulating DOAs were further investigated and 
      compared with the known P-gp model substrates sertraline and verapamil. ATPase 
      stimulation kinetics could be modeled for the entactogen 
      3,4-methylenedioxy-α-ethylphenethylamine (3,4-BDB), the hallucinogen 
      2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), the abused alkaloid glaucine, the opioid-like 
      drugs N-iso-propyl-1,2-diphenylethylamine (NPDPA), and 
      N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-ethoxypropanamine (PCEPA), with K(m) and V(max) values 
      within the same range as for verapamil or sertraline. As a consequence interactions 
      with other drugs being P-gp substrates might be considered to be very likely and 
      further studies should be encouraged.

TI  - Down-regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 2 (Abca2) reduces amyloid-β 
      production by altering Nicastrin maturation and intracellular localization.
PG  - 1100-11
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M111.288258 [doi]
AB  - Clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic evidence support the notion that 
      alteration of cholesterol homeostasis strongly predisposes to Alzheimer disease 
      (AD). The ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (Abca2), which plays a role in 
      intracellular sterol trafficking, has been genetically linked to AD. It is unclear 
      how these two processes are related. Here we demonstrate that down-regulation of 
      Abca2 in mammalian cells leads to decreased amyloid-β (Aβ) generation. In vitro 
      studies revealed altered γ-secretase complex formation in Abca2 knock-out cells due 
      to the altered levels, post-translational modification, and subcellular localization 
      of Nicastrin. Reduced Abca2 levels in mammalian cells in vitro, in Drosophila 
      melanogaster and in mice resulted in altered γ-secretase processing of APP, and thus 
      Aβ generation, without affecting Notch cleavage.

TI  - Transcriptome profiling of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci reveals stage-specific gene 
      expression signatures for thiamethoxam resistance.
PG  - 485-96
LID - 10.1111/imb.12038 [doi]
AB  - Bemisia tabaci has developed high levels of resistance to many insecticides 
      including the neonicotinoids and there is strong evidence that for some compounds 
      resistance is stage-specific. To investigate the molecular basis of B. tabaci 
      resistance to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam we used a custom whitefly microarray to 
      compare gene expression in the egg, nymph and adult stages of a 
      thiamethoxam-resistant strain (TH-R) with a susceptible strain (TH-S). Gene ontology 
      and bioinformatic analyses revealed that in all life stages many of the 
      differentially expressed transcripts encoded enzymes involved in metabolic processes 
      and/or metabolism of xenobiotics. Several of these are candidate resistance genes 
      and include the cytochrome P450 CYP6CM1, which has been shown to confer resistance 
      to several neonicotinoids previously, a P450 belonging to the Cytochrome P450s 4 
      family and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) belonging to the sigma class. Finally 
      several ATP-binding cassette transporters of the ABCG subfamily were highly 
      over-expressed in the adult stage of the TH-R strain and may play a role in 
      resistance by active efflux. Here, we evaluated both common and stage-specific gene 
      expression signatures and identified several candidate resistance genes that may 
      underlie B. tabaci resistance to thiamethoxam.

TI  - Identification of ABCC2 as a binding protein of Cry1Ac on brush border membrane 
      vesicles from Helicoverpa armigera by an improved pull-down assay.
PG  - 659-69
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.360 [doi]
AB  - Cry1Ac toxin-binding proteins from Helicoverpa armigera brush border membrane 
      vesicles were identified by an improved pull-down method that involves coupling 
      Cry1Ac to CNBr agarose combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). According to the LC-MS/MS results, Cry1Ac toxin could bind to six 
      classes of aminopeptidase-N, alkaline phosphatase, cadherin-like protein, 
      ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C protein (ABCC2), actin, ATPase, 
      polycalin, and some other proteins not previously characterized as Cry toxin-binding 
      molecules such as dipeptidyl peptidase or carboxyl/choline esterase and some serine 
      proteases. This is the first report that suggests the direct binding of Cry1Ac toxin 
      to ABCC2 in H. armigera.

TI  - Significant activity of ecdysteroids on the resistance to doxorubicin in mammalian 
      cancer cells expressing the human ABCB1 transporter.
PG  - 5034-43
LID - 10.1021/jm300424n [doi]
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause of failure of cancer chemotherapy. 
      Fifty-eight ecdysteroids, herbal analogues of the insect molting hormone and their 
      semisynthetic derivatives, were tested for their activity against L5178 mouse T-cell 
      lymphoma cells (non-MDR) and their subcell line transfected with pHa MDR1/A 
      retrovirus overexpressing the human ABCB1 efflux pump (MDR cell line). The compounds 
      showed very low antiproliferative activities but modulated the efflux of rhodamine 
      123 mediated by the ABCB1 transporter. Roughly depending on the polarity, mild to 
      strong synergism or antagonism was observed by combining ecdysteroids with 
      doxorubicin, and specific structure-activity relationships were also found. Our 
      results show the effect of ecdysteroids on MDR cancer cells for the first time. Less 
      polar derivatives may serve as valuable leads toward a potent and safe resistance 
      modulator. Biological significance of the resistance-increasing activity of the most 
      abundant phytoecdysteroids including 20-hydroxyecdysone is yet to be clarified.

AB  - The synthesis of eleven 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivatives presenting either a 
      monofluoro, difluoro, thiolated or unsaturated N-alkyl chain of various length is 
      described. Exploiting the unsaturated moiety on the nitrogen, fluorine has been 
      introduced through a HF/SbF5 superacid catalysed hydrofluorination and thiol-ene 
      click chemistry allowed introduction of sulfur. The synthetic derivatives have been 
      tested for their ability to inhibit glycosidases and correct F508del-CFTR. Two of 
      the unsaturated iminosugars exhibited potency similar to Miglustat as F508del-CFTR 
      correctors. The thioalkyl iminosugars as well as the corresponding alkyl iminosugars 
      demonstrated low micromolar α-glucosidases and trehalases inhibition. Introduction 
      of fluorine abolished F508del-CFTR correction and trehalase inhibition.

TI  - Comparative Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum Resistance-Associated Genetic 
      Polymorphisms in Parasites Infecting Humans and Mosquitoes in Uganda.
PG  - 1576-1580
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0351 [doi]
AB  - Controlling malaria in high transmission areas, such as much of sub-Saharan Africa, 
      will require concerted efforts to slow the spread of drug resistance and to impede 
      malaria transmission. Understanding the fitness costs associated with the 
      development of drug resistance, particularly within the context of transmission, can 
      help guide policy decisions to accomplish these goals, as fitness constraints might 
      lead to decreased transmission of drug-resistant strains. To determine if Plasmodium 
      falciparum resistance-mediating polymorphisms impact on development at different 
      parasite stages, we compared the genotypes of parasites infecting humans and 
      mosquitoes from households in Uganda. Genotypes at 14 polymorphic loci in genes 
      encoding putative transporters (pfcrt and pfmdr1) and folate pathway enzymes (pfdhfr 
      and pfdhps) were characterized using ligase detection reaction-fluorescent 
      microsphere assays. In paired analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, 
      prevalences of mutations at 12 loci did not differ significantly between parasites 
      infecting humans and mosquitoes. However, compared with parasites infecting humans, 
      those infecting mosquitoes were enriched for the pfmdr1 86Y mutant allele (P = 
      0.0001) and those infecting Anopheles gambiae s.s. were enriched for the pfmdr1 86Y 
      (P = 0.0001) and pfcrt 76T (P = 0.0412) mutant alleles. Our results suggest modest 
      directional selection resulting from varied fitness costs during the P. falciparum 
      life cycle. Better appreciation of the fitness implications of drug resistance 
      mediating mutations can inform optimal malaria treatment and prevention strategies.

AB  - How behavioural diversity emerged in evolution is an unexplored subject in biology. 
      To tackle this problem, genes and circuits for a behaviour need to be determined in 
      different species for phylogenetic comparisons. The recently developed clustered 
      regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein9 
      (CRISPR/Cas9) system made such a challenge possible by providing the means to induce 
      mutations in a gene of interest in any organism. Aiming at elucidating 
      diversification in genetic and neural networks for courtship behaviour, we attempted 
      to generate a genetic tool kit in Drosophila subobscura, a nonmodel species 
      distantly related to the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report the 
      generation of yellow (y) and white mutations with the aid of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, 
      and the rescue of the y mutant phenotype by germline transformation of the newly 
      established y mutant fly line with a y(+) -marked piggyBac vector. This successful 
      mutagenesis and transformation in D. subobscura open up an avenue for comprehensive 
      genetic analyses of higher functions in this and other nonmodel Drosophila species, 
      representing a key step toward systematic comparisons of genes and circuitries 
      underlying behaviour amongst species.

AB  - Mutations in the ABCC6 gene cause soft-tissue calcification in pseudoxanthoma 
      elasticum (PXE) and, in some patients, generalized arterial calcification of infancy 
      (GACI). PXE is characterized by late onset and progressive mineralization of elastic 
      fibers in dermal, ocular, and cardiovascular tissues. GACI patients present a more 
      severe, often prenatal arterial calcification. We have tested 10 frequent 
      disease-causing ABCC6 missense mutants for the transport activity by using Sf9 
      (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells, characterized the subcellular localization in MDCKII 
      (Madin-Darby canine kidney (cell line)) cells and in mouse liver, and tested the 
      phenotypic rescue in zebrafish. We aimed at identifying mutants with preserved 
      transport activity but with improper plasma membrane localization for rescue by the 
      chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). Seven of the mutants were 
      transport-competent but mislocalized in mouse liver. The observed divergence in 
      cellular localization of mutants in MDCKII cells versus mouse liver underlined the 
      limitations of this 2D in vitro cell system. The functionality of ABCC6 mutants was 
      tested in zebrafish, and minimal rescue of the morpholino-induced phenotype was 
      found. However, 4-PBA, a drug approved for clinical use, restored the plasma 
      membrane localization of four ABCC6 mutants (R1114P, S1121W, Q1347H, and R1314W), 
      suggesting that allele-specific therapy may be useful for selected patients with PXE 
      and GACI.

AB  - Metabolic resistance and the potential role of permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      efflux pumps were investigated in a pyrethroid-resistant wild Anopheles gambiae s.l. 
      Tiassalé population, using WHO susceptibility assays with deltamethrin (0.05%), with 
      and without pre-exposure to synergists. The synergists used included an inhibitor of 
      P-glycoprotein efflux pumps (verapamil), an inhibitor of esterases (EN 16-5), and an 
      inhibitor of P450s and esterases (piperonyl butoxide). Pre-exposure to verapamil 
      followed by deltamethrin led to a slight but non-significant (P=0.59) increase in 
      mortality relative to exposure to deltamethrin alone (64.5% versus 69.2%). 
      Similarly, pre-exposure to EN 16-5 yielded a non-significant increase in mortality 
      (to 76.6%; P=0.85) but a significant increase in the knock down rate (from 48.3% to 
      78.7%; P<0.01). Pre-exposure with PBO caused a significant increase in mortality (to 
      93.1%; P<0.001) and knockdown rate (100%; P<0.001), which related to a 2.9 fold 
      decrease in the resistance level. The results provide evidence that metabolic 
      resistance mechanisms are present within the assessed mosquito population. The 
      decrease in time to knock down of this population with deltamethrin following 
      exposure to EN16-5 and PBO is of particular relevance to vector control, where quick 
      knock down is a highly desired characteristic. The suspected resistance mechanisms 
      present in this population merit further investigation through biochemical and 
      molecular analyses for full resistance profile characterization. Bioassays with 
      synergists can provide a quick and easy basis for initial characterization of 
      resistant mosquito populations, without the need of preserved specimens, expensive 
      equipment and substrates or specialized expertise.

AB  - Although many insect cell lines derived from various tissues are available, it is 
      unclear whether endogenous receptors of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal toxins 
      are expressed in these cell lines. In the present study, we demonstrated that the 
      ovaries-derived Spodoptera litura Sl-HP cell line was susceptible to activated 
      Cry1Ac although larvae of S. litura are not susceptible to the toxin. Assays of the 
      transcriptome revealed that thirteen ATP-binding cassette transporter genes (ABC) 
      were expressed at different levels in this cell line. Of these, the SlABCC3 shared 
      52-55% amino acid sequence identity with the known Bt toxin receptor ABCC2. 
      RNAi-mediated knockdown targeting SlABCC3 significantly decreased the susceptibility 
      of Sl-HP cells to activated Cry1Ac. Over-expression of the gene strongly increased 
      the susceptibility of Trichoplusia ni Hi5 cells to the toxin. Not only was SlABCC3 
      comparable to the heterologously expressed Helicoverpa armigera Hacadherin on the 
      receptor-mediated cytotoxicity of activated Cry1Ac to Hi5 cells, but also SlABCC3 
      and Hacadherin had a strong synergistic effect on cytotoxicity of activated Cry1Ac. 
      These results suggested that Bt toxin receptors-expressing insect cell lines can be 
      used as an alternative model for evaluating cytotoxicity of Bt toxins and studying 
      their mechanisms of action.

AB  - Many insects have evolved resistance to abamectin but the mechanisms involved in 
      this resistance have not been well characterized. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an 
      ATP-dependent drug-efflux pump transmembrane protein, may be involved in abamectin 
      resistance. We investigated the role of P-gp in abamectin (ABM) resistance in 
      Drosophila using an ABM-resistant strain developed in the laboratory. A toxicity 
      assay, Western blotting analysis and a vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity assay all 
      demonstrated the existence of a direct relationship between P-gp expression and ABM 
      resistance in these flies. Our observations indicate that P-gp levels in flies' 
      heads were higher than in their thorax and abdomen, and that both P-gp levels and 
      LC(50) values were higher in resistant than in susceptible and P-gp-deficient 
      strains. In addition, P-gp levels in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of resistant 
      flies were higher than in susceptible and P-gp-deficient flies, which is further 
      evidence that a high level of P-gp in the BBB is related to ABM resistance. 
      Furthermore, we found greater expression of Drosophila EGFR (dEGFR) in the resistant 
      strain than in the susceptible strain, and that the level of Drosophila Akt (dAkt) 
      was much higher in resistant than in susceptible flies, whereas that in 
      P-gp-deficient flies was very low. Compared to susceptible flies, P-gp levels in the 
      resistant strain were markedly suppressed by the dEGFR and dAkt inhibitors lapatinib 
      and wortmannin. These results suggest that the increased P-gp in resistant flies was 
      regulated by the dEGFR and dAkt pathways and that increased expression of P-gp is an 
      important component of ABM resistance in insects.

TI  - The central cavity of ABCB1 undergoes alternating access during ATP hydrolysis.
PG  - 2190-2201
LID - 10.1111/febs.12773 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the process that underlies multidrug recognition and efflux by 
      P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) remains a key biological challenge. Structural data have 
      recently become available for the murine and Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of 
      ABCB1; however all structures were obtained in the absence of nucleotide. A feature 
      of these structures was the presence of a central cavity that is inaccessible from 
      the extracellular face of the protein. To determine the conformational dynamics of 
      this region several residues in transmembrane helices TM6 (331, 343 and 354) and 
      TM12 (980) were mutated to cysteine. Based upon structural predictions, these 
      residues are proposed to line, or reside proximal to, the central cavity. The mutant 
      isoforms were labelled with a paramagnetic probe enabling the application of EPR 
      spectroscopic methods. Power saturation EPR spectra were recorded in the presence of 
      hydrophobic (O2 ) or hydrophilic (NiEDDA) quenching agents to study the local 
      environment of each residue. ABCB1 was trapped in both its nucleotide-bound and 
      post-hydrolytic conformations and EPR spectra were again recorded in the presence 
      and absence of quenching agents. The EPR line shapes provide information on the 
      movements of these residues within TM6 and TM12 during ATP hydrolysis. 
      Rationalization of the data with molecular dynamic simulations indicates that the 
      cavity is converted to a configuration open to the aqueous phase following 
      nucleotide binding, thereby suggesting alternating access to the cavity on opposite 
      sides of the membrane during translocation.

AB  - Chromatin insulators block the action of transcriptional enhancers when interposed 
      between an enhancer and a promoter. In this study, we examined the role of chromatin 
      loops formed by two unrelated insulators, gypsy and Fab-7, in their 
      enhancer-blocking activity. To test for this activity, we selected the white 
      reporter gene that is activated by the eye-specific enhancer. The results showed 
      that one copy of the gypsy or Fab-7 insulator failed to block the eye enhancer in 
      most of genomic sites, whereas a chromatin loop formed by two gypsy insulators 
      flanking either the eye enhancer or the reporter completely blocked white 
      stimulation by the enhancer. However, strong enhancer blocking was achieved due not 
      only to chromatin loop formation but also to the direct interaction of the gypsy 
      insulator with the eye enhancer, which was confirmed by the 3C assay. In particular, 
      it was observed that Mod(mdg4)-67.2, a component of the gypsy insulator, interacted 
      with the Zeste protein, which is critical for the eye enhancer-white promoter 
      communication. These results suggest that efficient enhancer blocking depends on the 
      combination of two factors: chromatin loop formation by paired insulators, which 
      generates physical constraints for enhancer-promoter communication, and the direct 
      interaction of proteins recruited to an insulator and to the enhancer-promoter pair.

TI  - Larval application of sodium channel homologous dsRNA restores pyrethroid 
      insecticide susceptibility in a resistant adult mosquito population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes host and pass on to humans a variety of disease-causing 
      pathogens such as infectious viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. The 
      emergence and spread of insecticide resistance is threatening the effectiveness of 
      current control measures for common mosquito vector borne diseases, such as malaria, 
      dengue and Zika. Therefore, the emerging resistance to the widely used pyrethroid 
      insecticides is an alarming problem for public health. Herein we demonstrated the 
      use of RNA interference (RNAi) to increase susceptibility of adult mosquitoes to a 
      widely used pyrethroid insecticide. METHODS: Experiments were performed on a 
      field-collected pyrethroid resistant strain of Ae. aegypti (Rio de Janeiro; RJ). 
      Larvae from the resistant Ae. aegypti population were soaked with double-stranded 
      RNAs (dsRNAs) that correspond either to voltage-gate sodium channel (VGSC), 
      P-glycoprotein, or P450 detoxification genes and reared to adulthood. Adult 
      mortality rates in the presence of various Deltamethrin pyrethroid concentrations 
      were used to assess mosquito insecticide susceptibility. RESULTS: We characterized 
      the RJ Ae. aegypti strain with regard to its level of resistance to a pyrethroid 
      insecticide and found that it was approximately 6 times more resistant to 
      Deltamethrin compared to the laboratory Rockefeller strain. The RJ strain displayed 
      a higher frequency of Val1016Ile and Phe1534Cys substitutions of the VGSC gene. The 
      resistant strain also displayed a higher basal expression level of VGSC compared to 
      the Rockefeller strain. When dsRNA-treated mosquitoes were subjected to a standard 
      pyrethroid contact bioassay, only dsRNA targeting VGSC increased the adult mortality 
      of the pyrethroid resistant strain. The dsRNA treatment proved effective in 
      increasing adult mosquito susceptibility over a range of pyrethroid concentrations 
      and these results were associated with dsRNA-specific small interfering RNAs in 
      treated adults, and the corresponding specific down regulation of VGSC gene 
      expression level. Finally, we demonstrated that the efficiency of our approach was 
      further improved by 'tiling' along the VGSC gene in order to identify the most 
      potent dsRNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that dsRNA applied to 
      mosquito larvae retains its biological activity into adulthood. Thus, the RNAi 
      system reported here could be a useful approach to control the widespread 
      insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and other insect vectors of human diseases.

TI  - Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are uniformly distributed on motile cilia in the 
      oviduct and the respiratory airways.
PG  - 339-53
LID - 10.1007/s00418-011-0904-1 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are located on the apical surface of cells and 
      funnel Na(+) ions from the lumen into the cell. ENaC function also regulates 
      extracellular fluid volume as water flows across membranes accompanying Na(+) ions 
      to maintain osmolarity. To examine the sites of expression and intracellular 
      localization of ENaC, we generated polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular 
      domain of human α-ENaC subunit that we expressed in E. coli. Three-dimensional (3D) 
      confocal microscopy of immunofluorescence using these antibodies for the first time 
      revealed that ENaCs are uniformly distributed on the ciliary surface in all 
      epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus in human lung and female 
      reproductive tract, all along the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, the ampulla 
      and rare cells in the uterine glands. Quantitative analysis indicated that cilia 
      increase cell surface area >70-fold and the amount of ENaC on cilia is >1,000-fold 
      higher than on non-ciliated cell surface. These findings indicate that ENaC 
      functions as a regulator of the osmolarity of the periciliary fluid bathing the 
      cilia. In contrast to ENaC, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
      (CFTR) that channels chloride ions from the cytoplasm to the lumen is located mainly 
      on the apical side, but not on cilia. The cilial localization of ENaC requires 
      reevaluation of the mechanisms of action of CFTR and other modulators of ENaC 
      function. ENaC on motile cilia should be essential for diverse functions of motile 
      cilia, such as germ cell transport, fertilization, implantation, clearance of 
      respiratory airways and cell migration.

AB  - On the basis of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) protein binding site for 
      diflubenzuron and glibenclamide, 15 new benzoylphenylureas containing amide and 
      sulfonate groups were designed and synthesized. Their structures were characterized 
      by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis [or high-resolution 
      mass spectrometry (HRMS)]. The larvicidal activities of the new compounds against 
      oriental armyworm and diamondback moth were evaluated. Compound II-3 showed nearly 
      the same level of insecticidal activity against oriental armyworm as commercial 
      insecticide flucycloxuron and, thus, emerged as a new lead compound for the 
      development of new benzoylurea insecticides.

TI  - Insect Resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Toxin Cry2Ab Is Conferred by Mutations 
      in an ABC Transporter Subfamily A Protein.
PG  - e1005534
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005534 [doi]
LID - e1005534
AB  - The use of conventional chemical insecticides and bacterial toxins to control 
      lepidopteran pests of global agriculture has imposed significant selection pressure 
      leading to the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance. Transgenic crops (e.g., 
      cotton) expressing the Bt Cry toxins are now used world wide to control these pests, 
      including the highly polyphagous and invasive cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. 
      Since 2004, the Cry2Ab toxin has become widely used for controlling H. armigera, 
      often used in combination with Cry1Ac to delay resistance evolution. Isolation of H. 
      armigera and H. punctigera individuals heterozygous for Cry2Ab resistance in 2002 
      and 2004, respectively, allowed aspects of Cry2Ab resistance (level, fitness costs, 
      genetic dominance, complementation tests) to be characterised in both species. 
      However, the gene identity and genetic changes conferring this resistance were 
      unknown, as was the detailed Cry2Ab mode of action. No cross-resistance to Cry1Ac 
      was observed in mutant lines. Biphasic linkage analysis of a Cry2Ab-resistant H. 
      armigera family followed by exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) marker mapping and 
      candidate gene sequencing identified three independent resistance-associated INDEL 
      mutations in an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter gene we named HaABCA2. A 
      deletion mutation was also identified in the H. punctigera homolog from the 
      resistant line. All mutations truncate the ABCA2 protein. Isolation of further 
      Cry2Ab resistance alleles in the same gene from field H. armigera populations 
      indicates unequal resistance allele frequencies and the potential for Bt resistance 
      evolution. Identification of the gene involved in resistance as an ABC transporter 
      of the A subfamily adds to the body of evidence on the crucial role this gene family 
      plays in the mode of action of the Bt Cry toxins. The structural differences between 
      the ABCA2, and that of the C subfamily required for Cry1Ac toxicity, indicate 
      differences in the detailed mode-of-action of the two Bt Cry toxins.

TI  - Midgut Transcriptome of the Cockroach Periplaneta americana and Its Microbiota: 
      Digestion, Detoxification and Oxidative Stress Response.

AB  - The cockroach, Periplaneta americana, is an obnoxious and notorious pest of the 
      world, with a strong ability to adapt to a variety of complex environments. However, 
      the molecular mechanism of this adaptability is mostly unknown. In this study, the 
      genes and microbiota composition associated with the adaptation mechanism were 
      studied by analyzing the transcriptome and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing of the P. 
      americana midgut, respectively. Midgut transcriptome analysis identified 82,905 
      unigenes, among which 64 genes putatively involved in digestion (11 genes), 
      detoxification (37 genes) and oxidative stress response (16 genes) were found. 
      Evaluation of gene expression following treatment with cycloxaprid further revealed 
      that the selected genes (CYP6J1, CYP4C1, CYP6K1, Delta GST, alpha-amylase, 
      beta-glucosidase and aminopeptidase) were upregulated at least 2.0-fold at the 
      transcriptional level, and four genes were upregulated more than 10.0-fold. An 
      interesting finding was that three digestive enzymes positively responded to 
      cycloxaprid application. Tissue expression profiles further showed that most of the 
      selected genes were midgut-biased, with the exception of CYP6K1. The midgut 
      microbiota composition was obtained via 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and was found to be 
      mainly dominated by organisms from the Firmicutes phylum, among which Clostridiales, 
      Lactobacillales and Burkholderiales were the main orders which might assist the host 
      in the food digestion or detoxification of noxious compounds. The preponderant 
      species, Clostridium cellulovorans, was previously reported to degrade 
      lignocellulose efficiently in insects. The abundance of genes involved in digestion, 
      detoxification and response to oxidative stress, and the diversity of microbiota in 
      the midgut might provide P. americana high capacity to adapt to complex 
      environments.

TI  - The neuronal protein Neurexin directly interacts with the Scribble-Pix complex to 
      stimulate F-actin assembly for synaptic vesicle clustering.
PG  - 14334-14348
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.794040 [doi]
AB  - Synaptic vesicles (SVs) form distinct pools at synaptic terminals, and this 
      well-regulated separation is necessary for normal neurotransmission. However, how 
      the SV cluster, in particular synaptic compartments, maintains normal 
      neurotransmitter release remains a mystery. The presynaptic protein Neurexin (NRX) 
      plays a significant role in synaptic architecture and function, and some evidence 
      suggests that NRX is associated with neurological disorders, including autism 
      spectrum disorders. However, the role of NRX in SV clustering is unclear. Here, 
      using the neuromuscular junction at the 2-3 instar stages of Drosophila larvae as a 
      model and biochemical imaging and electrophysiology techniques, we demonstrate that 
      Drosophila NRX (DNRX) plays critical roles in regulating synaptic terminal 
      clustering and release of SVs. We found that DNRX controls the terminal clustering 
      and release of SVs by stimulating presynaptic F-actin. Furthermore, our results 
      indicate that DNRX functions through the scaffold protein Scribble and the GEF 
      protein DPix to activate the small GTPase Ras-related C3 Botulinum toxin substrate 1 
      (Rac1). We observed a direct interaction between the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of 
      DNRX and the PDZ domains of Scribble and that Scribble bridges DNRX to DPix, forming 
      a DNRX-Scribble-DPix complex that activates Rac1 and subsequently stimulates 
      presynaptic F-actin assembly and SV clustering. Taken together, our work provides 
      important insights into the function of DNRX in regulating SV clustering, which 
      could help inform further research into pathological neurexin-mediated mechanisms in 
      neurological disorders such as autism.

AB  - The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays a critical role in 
      the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. TAP translocates cellular peptides 
      across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. We 
      used FRET spectroscopy in permeabilized cells to delineate different conformational 
      states of TAP in a native subcellular membrane environment. For these studies, we 
      tagged the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and 
      enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, respectively, C-terminally to their nucleotide 
      binding domains (NBDs), and measured FRET efficiencies under different conditions. 
      Our data indicate that both ATP and ADP enhance the FRET efficiencies but that 
      neither induces a maximally closed NBD conformation. Additionally, peptide binding 
      induces a large and significant increase in NBD proximity with a concentration 
      dependence that is reflective of individual peptide affinities for TAP, revealing 
      the underlying mechanism of peptide-stimulated ATPase activity of TAP. Maximal NBD 
      closure is induced by the combination of peptide and non-hydrolysable ATP analogs. 
      Thus, TAP1-TAP2 NBD dimers are not fully stabilized by nucleotides alone, and 
      substrate binding plays a key role in inducing the transition state conformations of 
      the NBD. Taken together, these findings show that at least three steps are involved 
      in the transport of peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane for antigen 
      presentation, corresponding to three dynamically and structurally distinct 
      conformational states of TAP. Our studies elucidate structural changes in the TAP 
      NBD in response to nucleotides and substrate, providing new insights into the 
      mechanism of ATP-binding cassette transporter function.

TI  - The Role of Blm Helicase in Homologous Recombination, Gene Conversion Tract Length, 
      and Recombination Between Diverged Sequences in Drosophilamelanogaster.
PG  - 923-933
LID - 10.1534/genetics.117.300285 [doi]
AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a particularly deleterious class of DNA damage 
      that threatens genome integrity. DSBs are repaired by three pathways: 
      nonhomologous-end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and single-strand 
      annealing (SSA). Drosophila melanogaster Blm (DmBlm) is the ortholog of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae SGS1 and human BLM, and has been shown to suppress 
      crossovers in mitotic cells and repair mitotic DNA gaps via HR. To further elucidate 
      the role of DmBlm in repair of a simple DSB, and in particular recombination 
      mechanisms, we utilized the Direct Repeat of white (DR-white) and Direct Repeat of 
      whitewith mutations (DR-white.mu) repair assays in multiple mutant allele 
      backgrounds. DmBlm null and helicase-dead mutants both demonstrated a decrease in 
      repair by noncrossover HR, and a concurrent increase in non-HR events, possibly 
      including SSA, crossovers, deletions, and NHEJ, although detectable processing of 
      the ends was not significantly impacted. Interestingly, gene conversion tract 
      lengths of HR repair events were substantially shorter in DmBlm null but not 
      helicase-dead mutants, compared to heterozygote controls. Using DR-white.mu, we 
      found that, in contrast to Sgs1, DmBlm is not required for suppression of 
      recombination between diverged sequences. Taken together, our data suggest that 
      DmBlm helicase function plays a role in HR, and the steps that contribute to 
      determining gene conversion tract length are helicase-independent.

AB  - Bt toxins ingested by insect pests can bind to midgut receptors and cause death, 
      although several steps in this process remain unclear. Multiple Bt toxin receptors 
      have been identified in Lepidoptera, including a cadherin-like protein (CaLP), which 
      is central to several models explaining Bt toxins' mode of action. Mutations in the 
      Plutella xylostella ATP-dependent binding cassette transporter C2 (Px-abcc2), rather 
      than CaLP, are genetically linked with Bt Cry1Ac resistance. Here we expressed 
      Px-abcc2 in Drosophila and performed larval bioassays to determine whether this 
      protein acts as an effective Bt receptor. Cry1Ac had no effect on larvae expressing 
      Px-abcc2 in salivary glands, yet larvae expressing Px-abcc2 in the midgut were 
      highly susceptible to both Cry1Ac protoxin and trypsin activated toxin. Furthermore, 
      the CaLP orthologue has been lost from the Drosophila genome, making this a useful 
      system for investigating the role of CaLP peptides from Manduca sexta (CR12-MPED), 
      which are known to act as Bt synergists in larval feeding assays. Drosophila larvae 
      expressing Px-ABCC2 in the midgut were fed LD(50) concentrations of Cry1Ac toxin or 
      protoxin, plus purified CR12-MPED cloned from M. sexta or P. xylostella. The 
      M. sexta CR12-MPED protein acted synergistically with Cry1Ac protoxin and activated 
      toxin significantly more effectively than the P. xylostella peptide. This work 
      demonstrates ABCC2 is the major functional Cry1Ac receptor for P. xylostella and the 
      importance of CaLP proteins in Bt mode of action may vary between different 
      lepidopteran species.

AB  - Field evolved resistance of insect populations to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 
      crystalline (Cry) toxins expressed by crop plants has resulted in reduced control of 
      insect feeding damage to field crops, and threatens the sustainability of Bt 
      transgenic technologies. A single quantitative trait locus (QTL) that determines 
      resistance in Ostrinia nubilalis larvae capable of surviving on reproductive stage 
      transgenic corn that express the Bt Cry1Fa toxin was previously mapped to linkage 
      group 12 (LG12) in a backcross pedigree. Fine mapping with high-throughput single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) anchor markers, a candidate ABC transporter (abcc2) 
      marker, and de novo mutations predicted from a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data 
      redefined a 268.8 cM LG12. The single QTL on LG12 spanned an approximate 46.1 cM 
      region, in which marker 02302.286 and abcc2 were ≤ 2.81 cM, and the GBS marker 697 
      was an estimated 1.89 cM distant from the causal genetic factor. This positional 
      mapping data showed that an O. nubilalis genome region encoding an abcc2 transporter 
      is in proximity to a single QTL involved in the inheritance of Cry1F resistance, and 
      will assist in the future identification the mutation(s) involved with this 
      phenotype.

TI  - Single amino acid insertions in extracellular loop 2 of Bombyx mori ABCC2 disrupt 
      its receptor function for Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac but not Cry1Aa 
      toxins.

AB  - In a previous report, seven Cry1Ab-resistant strains were identified in the 
      silkworm, Bombyx mori; these strains were shown to have a tyrosine insertion at 
      position 234 in extracellular loop 2 of the ABC transporter C2 (BmABCC2). This 
      insertion was confirmed to destroy the receptor function of BmABCC2 and confer the 
      strains resistance against Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac. However, these strains were 
      susceptible to Cry1Aa. In this report, we examined the mechanisms of the loss of 
      receptor function of the transporter by expressing mutations in Sf9 cells. After 
      replacement of one or two of the five amino acid residues in loop 2 of the 
      susceptible BmABCC2 gene [BmABCC2_S] with alanine, cells still showed 
      susceptibility, retaining the receptor function. Five mutants with single amino acid 
      insertions at position 234 in BmABCC2 were also generated, resulting in loop 2 
      having six amino acids, which corresponds to replacing the tyrosine insertion in the 
      resistant BmABCC2 gene [BmABCC2_R(+(234)Y)] with another amino acid. All five 
      mutants exhibited loss of function against Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac. These results suggest 
      that the amino acid sequence in loop 2 is less important than the loop size (five 
      vs. six amino acids) or loop structure for Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac activity. Several 
      domain-swapped mutant toxins were then generated among Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac, 
      which are composed of three domains. Swapped mutants containing domain II of Cry1Ab 
      or Cry1Ac did not kill Sf9 cells expressing BmABCC2_R(+(234)Y), suggesting that 
      domain II of the Cry toxin is related to the interaction with the receptor function 
      of BmABCC2. This also suggests that different reactions against Bt-toxins in some B. 
      mori strains, that is, Cry1Ab resistance or Cry1Aa susceptibility, are attributable 
      to structural differences in domain II of Cry1A toxins.

TI  - Mutations of the central tyrosines of putative cholesterol recognition amino acid 
      consensus (CRAC) sequences modify folding, activity, and sterol-sensing of the human 
      ABCG2 multidrug transporter.

AB  - Human ABCG2 is a plasma membrane glycoprotein causing multidrug resistance in 
      cancer. Membrane cholesterol and bile acids are efficient regulators of ABCG2 
      function, while the molecular nature of the sterol-sensing sites has not been 
      elucidated. The cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC, 
      L/V-(X)(1-5)-Y-(X)(1-5)-R/K) sequence is one of the conserved motifs involved in 
      cholesterol binding in several proteins. We have identified five potential CRAC 
      motifs in the transmembrane domain of the human ABCG2 protein. In order to define 
      their roles in sterol-sensing, the central tyrosines of these CRACs (Y413, 459, 469, 
      570 and 645) were mutated to S or F and the mutants were expressed both in insect 
      and mammalian cells. We found that mutation in Y459 prevented protein expression; 
      the Y469S and Y645S mutants lost their activity; while the Y570S, Y469F, and Y645F 
      mutants retained function as well as cholesterol and bile acid sensitivity. We found 
      that in the case of the Y413S mutant, drug transport was efficient, while modulation 
      of the ATPase activity by cholesterol and bile acids was significantly altered. We 
      suggest that the Y413 residue within a putative CRAC motif has a role in 
      sterol-sensing and the ATPase/drug transport coupling in the ABCG2 multidrug 
      transporter.

TI  - H3S10 phosphorylation by the JIL-1 kinase regulates H3K9 dimethylation and gene 
      expression at the white locus in Drosophila.
PG  - 93-7
LID - 10.4161/fly.20029 [doi]
AB  - The JIL-1 kinase is a multidomain protein that localizes specifically to euchromatin 
      interband regions of polytene chromosomes and is the kinase responsible for histone 
      H3S10 phosphorylation at interphase. Genetic interaction assays have suggested that 
      the function of the epigenetic histone H3S10ph mark is to antagonize 
      heterochromatization by participating in a dynamic balance between factors promoting 
      repression and activation of gene expression as measured by position-effect 
      variegation (PEV) assays. Interestingly, JIL-1 loss-of-function alleles can act 
      either as an enhancer or indirectly as a suppressor of w(m4) PEV depending on the 
      precise levels of JIL-1 kinase activity. In this study, we have explored the 
      relationship between PEV and the relative levels of the H3S10ph and H3K9me2 marks at 
      the white gene in both wild-type and w(m4) backgrounds by ChIP analysis. Our results 
      indicate that H3K9me2 levels at the white gene directly correlate with its level of 
      expression and that H3K9me2 levels in turn are regulated by H3S10 phosphorylation.

TI  - Measurement of transport activities of 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids in bile salt 
      export pump and multidrug resistance-associated proteins using LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 559-66
AB  - A method has been developed for the measurement of transport activities in membrane 
      vesicles obtained from Sf9 cells for 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids by high-performance 
      liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration 
      curves for the bile acids were linear over the range of 10 to 2000 pmol/mL, and the 
      detection limit was less than 1 pmol/mL for 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids using 
      selected reaction monitoring analysis. The analytical method was applied to 
      measurements of transport activities in membrane vesicles obtained from human 
      multidrug resistance-associated protein 2-, 3-, and human bile salt export 
      pump-expressing Sf9 cells for conjugated 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids. The present 
      study demonstrated that human multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 vesicles 
      accepted conjugated 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids along with common bile acids such as 
      glycocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate.

TI  - The Drosophila Transcription Factors Tinman and Pannier Activate and Collaborate 
      with Myocyte Enhancer Factor-2 to Promote Heart Cell Fate.
PG  - e0132965
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0132965 [doi]
LID - e0132965
AB  - Expression of the MADS domain transcription factor Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2) 
      is regulated by numerous and overlapping enhancers which tightly control its 
      transcription in the mesoderm. To understand how Mef2 expression is controlled in 
      the heart, we identified a late stage Mef2 cardiac enhancer that is active in all 
      heart cells beginning at stage 14 of embryonic development. This enhancer is 
      regulated by the NK-homeodomain transcription factor Tinman, and the GATA 
      transcription factor Pannier through both direct and indirect interactions with the 
      enhancer. Since Tinman, Pannier and MEF2 are evolutionarily conserved from 
      Drosophila to vertebrates, and since their vertebrate homologs can convert mouse 
      fibroblast cells to cardiomyocytes in different activator cocktails, we tested 
      whether over-expression of these three factors in vivo could ectopically activate 
      known cardiac marker genes. We found that mesodermal over-expression of Tinman and 
      Pannier resulted in approximately 20% of embryos with ectopic Hand and Sulphonylurea 
      receptor (Sur) expression. By adding MEF2 alongside Tinman and Pannier, a dramatic 
      expansion in the expression of Hand and Sur was observed in almost all embryos 
      analyzed. Two additional cardiac markers were also expanded in their expression. Our 
      results demonstrate the ability to initiate ectopic cardiac fate in vivo by the 
      combination of only three members of the conserved Drosophila cardiac transcription 
      network, and provide an opportunity for this genetic model system to be used to 
      dissect the mechanisms of cardiac specification.

AB  - The identification of natural products exerting a combined effect with therapeutic 
      agents could be an alternative for cancer treatment, reducing the concentration of 
      the drugs and side effects. Geopropolis (Geo) is produced by some stingless bees 
      from a mixture of vegetable resins, gland secretions of the bees and soil. It has 
      been used popularly as an antiseptic agent and to treat respiratory diseases and 
      dermatosis. To determine whether Geo enhances the anticancer effect of carboplatin, 
      methotrexate and doxorubicin (DOX), human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) 
      cells were treated with Geo alone or in combination with each drug. Cell growth, 
      cytotoxicity and apoptosis were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethyl 
      thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH) release, and flow cytometry. Scratch assay was used to analyze cell migration 
      and transmission electron microscopy to observe morphologic alterations. The 
      influence of Geo on drug resistance was also investigated assessing P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) action. Geo inhibited cell proliferation and migration. The combination 
      Geo+DOX led to the highest cytotoxic activity and induced apoptosis, leading to loss 
      of membrane integrity. Geo had no effect on P-gp-mediated efflux of DOX. Data 
      indicate that Geo combined with DOX could be a potential clinical chemotherapeutic

TI  - FOXA transcriptional factor modulates insect susceptibility to Bacillus 
      thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin by regulating the expression of toxin-receptor ABCC2 and 
      ABCC3 genes.

AB  - Cry toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are insecticidal proteins widely 
      used in insect control. Recently, it was shown that ATP-binding cassette transporter 
      proteins (ABC) such as ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCG1 and ABCA2 are implicated in the 
      insecticidal action of Cry toxins as putative receptors. However, the 
      transcriptional regulators involved in the expression of ABC transporter genes 
      remain unknown. Sequence analysis of promoter regions of ABCC2 gene from Helicoverpa 
      armigera and ABCC3 gene from Spodoptera litura Sl-HP cultured cells, revealed the 
      potential participation of Forkhead box protein A (FOXA), a transcription factor 
      that regulates the expression of genes through remodeling chromatin. To determine if 
      FOXA was involved in regulating expression of ABCC2 and ABCC3 genes, the expression 
      of FOXA, ABCC2 and ABCC3 was compared in Sl-HP cells that are sensitive to Cry1Ac 
      toxin with those in S. frugiperda Sf9 cells that are not sensitive to the toxin. 
      Expression levels of those genes were significantly higher in Sl-HP than in Sf9 
      cells. Transient expression of FOXA in Sf9 cells activated ABCC2 and ABCC3 
      transcription, which directly correlated with enhanced Cry1Ac-susceptibility in 
      these cells. Silencing of FOXA gene expression by RNAi in H. armigera larvae 
      resulted in a decreased expression of ABCC2 and ABCC3 without affecting expression 
      of other Cry toxin receptor genes such as alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase or 
      cadherin. Silencing of FOXA gene expression also resulted in a Cry1Ac-tolerant 
      phenotype since lower mortality and higher pupation rate were observed in diet 
      containing Cry1Ac protoxin in comparison with the control group. These results 
      demonstrate that FOXA up-regulates expression of the Cry1Ac-toxin receptor ABCC2 and 
      ABCC3 genes, and that lower FOXA expression correlates with tolerance to Cry toxin 
      in cell lines and in lepidopteran larvae.

TI  - Analysis of the Olive Fruit Fly Bactrocera oleae Transcriptome and Phylogenetic 
      Classification of the Major Detoxification Gene Families.
PG  - e66533

AB  - The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae has a unique ability to cope with olive flesh, 
      and is the most destructive pest of olives worldwide. Its control has been largely 
      based on the use of chemical insecticides, however, the selection of insecticide 
      resistance against several insecticides has evolved. The study of detoxification 
      mechanisms, which allow the olive fruit fly to defend against insecticides, and/or 
      phytotoxins possibly present in the mesocarp, has been hampered by the lack of 
      genomic information in this species. In the NCBI database less than 1,000 nucleotide 
      sequences have been deposited, with less than 10 detoxification gene homologues in 
      total. We used 454 pyrosequencing to produce, for the first time, a large 
      transcriptome dataset for B. oleae. A total of 482,790 reads were assembled into 
      14,204 contigs. More than 60% of those contigs (8,630) were larger than 500 base 
      pairs, and almost half of them matched with genes of the order of the Diptera. 
      Analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) distribution of unique contigs, suggests that, 
      compared to other insects, the assembly is broadly representative for the B. oleae 
      transcriptome. Furthermore, the transcriptome was found to contain 55 P450, 43 GST-, 
      15 CCE- and 18 ABC transporter-genes. Several of those detoxification genes, may 
      putatively be involved in the ability of the olive fruit fly to deal with 
      xenobiotics, such as plant phytotoxins and insecticides. In summary, our study has 
      generated new data and genomic resources, which will substantially facilitate 
      molecular studies in B. oleae, including elucidation of detoxification mechanisms of 
      xenobiotic, as well as other important aspects of olive fruit fly biology.

TI  - Functional evidence for physiological mechanisms to circumvent neurotoxicity of 
      cardenolides in an adapted and a non-adapted hawk-moth species.
PG  - 20123089
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2012.3089 [doi]
LID - 20123089
AB  - Because cardenolides specifically inhibit the Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, insects feeding on 
      cardenolide-containing plants need to circumvent this toxic effect. Some insects 
      such as the monarch butterfly rely on target site insensitivity, yet other 
      cardenolide-adapted lepidopterans such as the oleander hawk-moth, Daphnis nerii, 
      possess highly sensitive Na(+)K(+)-ATPases. Nevertheless, larvae of this species and 
      the related Manduca sexta are insensitive to injected cardenolides. By 
      radioactive-binding assays with nerve cords of both species, we demonstrate that the 
      perineurium surrounding the nervous tissue functions as a diffusion barrier for a 
      polar cardenolide (ouabain). By contrast, for non-polar cardenolides such as digoxin 
      an active efflux carrier limits the access to the nerve cord. This barrier can be 
      abolished by metabolic inhibitors and by verapamil, a specific inhibitor of 
      P-glycoproteins (PGPs). This supports that a PGP-like transporter is involved in the 
      active cardenolide-barrier of the perineurium. Tissue specific RT-PCR demonstrated 
      expression of three PGP-like genes in hornworm nerve cords, and immunohistochemistry 
      further corroborated PGP expression in the perineurium. Our results thus suggest 
      that the lepidopteran perineurium serves as a diffusion barrier for polar 
      cardenolides and provides an active barrier for non-polar cardenolides. This may 
      explain the high in vivo resistance to cardenolides observed in some lepidopteran 
      larvae, despite their highly sensitive Na(+)K(+)-ATPases.

TI  - [The Effect of Transcription on Enhancer Activity in Drosophila melanogaster].
PG  - 37-46
AB  - In higher eukaryotes, the level of gene transcription is under the control of DNA 
      regulatory elements, such as promoter, from which transcription is initiated with 
      the participation of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, as well as 
      the enhancer, which increase the rate of transcription with the involvement of 
      activator proteins and cofactors. It was demonstrated that enhancers are often 
      located in the transcribed regions of the genome. We showed earlier that 
      transcription negatively affected the activity of enhancers in Drosophila in model 
      transgenic systems. In this study, we tested the effect of the distance between the 
      leading promoter, enhancer, and target promoter on the inhibitory effect of 
      transcriptions of different strengths. It was demonstrated that the negative effect 
      of transcription remained, but weakened with increased distance between the leading 
      promoter and enhancer and with decreased distance between the enhancer and target 
      promoter. Thus, transcription can modulate the activity of enhancers by controlling 
      its maximum level.

TI  - The Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) ABCC2 Mediates Cry1Ac Cytotoxicity 
      and, in Conjunction with Cadherin, Contributes to Enhance Cry1Ca Toxicity in Sf9 
      Cells.
PG  - 2281-2289
AB  - In insects, the mode of Cry1A toxins action has been studied in detail and many 
      receptors that participate in the process are known. Recent evidence has revealed 
      that an ABC transporter (ABCC2) is involved in conferring resistance to Cry1A toxins 
      and that ABCC2 could be a receptor of Cry1A. However, it is not known whether Cry1Ca 
      interacts with the same receptor proteins as Cry1A. In this study, we report the 
      cloning of an ABC transporter gene, SeABCC2b, from the midgut of Spodoptera exigua 
      (Hübner) larvae, and its expression in Sf9 cells for a functional analysis. The 
      addition of Cry1Ca and Cry1Ac to Sf9 cell culture caused swelling in 28.5% and 93.9% 
      of the SeABCC2-expressing cells, respectively. In contrast, only 7.4% and 1.3% of 
      the controls cells swelled in the presence of Cry1Ca and Cry1Ac. Thus, 
      SeABCC2b-expressing Sf9 cells had increased susceptibility to Cry1Ca and Cry1Ac. 
      Similarly, S. exigua cadherin (SeCad1b) expressed in Sf9 cells caused 47.1% and 1.8% 
      of the SeCad1b-expressing cells to swell to Cry1Ca and Cry1Ac exposure. Therefore, 
      Sf9 cells expressing SeCad1b were more sensitive to Cry1Ca than Cry1Ac. Together, 
      our data suggest that SeABCC2b from S. exigua mediates Cry1Ac cytotoxicity and, in 
      conjunction with SeCad1b, contributes to enhance Cry1Ca toxicity in Sf9 cells.

TI  - MAPK signaling pathway alters expression of midgut ALP and ABCC genes and causes 
      resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin in diamondback moth.
PG  - e1005124

AB  - Insecticidal crystal toxins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis 
      (Bt) are widely used as biopesticide sprays or expressed in transgenic crops to 
      control insect pests. However, large-scale use of Bt has led to field-evolved 
      resistance in several lepidopteran pests. Resistance to Bt Cry1Ac toxin in the 
      diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), was previously mapped to a multigenic 
      resistance locus (BtR-1). Here, we assembled the 3.15 Mb BtR-1 locus and found 
      high-level resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt biopesticide in four independent P. 
      xylostella strains were all associated with differential expression of a midgut 
      membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP) outside this locus and a suite of 
      ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C (ABCC) genes inside this locus. The 
      interplay between these resistance genes is controlled by a previously 
      uncharacterized trans-regulatory mechanism via the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) signaling pathway. Molecular, biochemical, and functional analyses have 
      established ALP as a functional Cry1Ac receptor. Phenotypic association experiments 
      revealed that the recessive Cry1Ac resistance was tightly linked to down-regulation 
      of ALP, ABCC2 and ABCC3, whereas it was not linked to up-regulation of ABCC1. 
      Silencing of ABCC2 and ABCC3 in susceptible larvae reduced their susceptibility to 
      Cry1Ac but did not affect the expression of ALP, whereas suppression of MAP4K4, a 
      constitutively transcriptionally-activated MAPK upstream gene within the BtR-1 
      locus, led to a transient recovery of gene expression thereby restoring the 
      susceptibility in resistant larvae. These results highlight a crucial role for ALP 
      and ABCC genes in field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac and reveal a novel 
      trans-regulatory signaling mechanism responsible for modulating the expression of 
      these pivotal genes in P. xylostella.

      resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ab in the silkworm, Bombyx mori.

AB  - Bt toxins derived from the arthropod bacterial pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis are 
      widely used for insect control as insecticides or in transgenic crops. Bt resistance 
      has been found in field populations of several lepidopteran pests and in laboratory 
      strains selected with Bt toxin. Widespread planting of crops expressing Bt toxins 
      has raised concerns about the potential increase of resistance mutations in targeted 
      insects. By using Bombyx mori as a model, we identified a candidate gene for a 
      recessive form of resistance to Cry1Ab toxin on chromosome 15 by positional cloning. 
      BGIBMGA007792-93, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter similar to human 
      multidrug resistance protein 4 and orthologous to genes associated with recessive 
      resistance to Cry1Ac in Heliothis virescens and two other lepidopteran species, was 
      expressed in the midgut. Sequences of 10 susceptible and seven resistant silkworm 
      strains revealed a common tyrosine insertion in an outer loop of the predicted 
      transmembrane structure of resistant alleles. We confirmed the role of this 
      ATP-binding cassette transporter gene in Bt resistance by converting a resistant 
      silkworm strain into a susceptible one by using germline transformation. This study 
      represents a direct demonstration of Bt resistance gene function in insects with the 
      use of transgenesis.

AB  - Insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are highly 
      active against Lepidoptera. However, field-evolved resistance to Bt toxins is on the 
      rise. The 12-cadherin domain protein HevCaLP and the ABC transporter HevABCC2 are 
      both genetically linked to Cry toxin resistance in Heliothis virescens. We 
      investigated their interaction using stably expressing non-lytic clonal Sf9 cell 
      lines expressing either protein or both together. Untransfected Sf9 cells are 
      innately sensitive to Cry1Ca toxin, but not to Cry1A toxins; and quantitative PCR 
      revealed negligible expression of genes involved in Cry1A toxicity such as cadherin, 
      ABCC2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aminopeptidase N (APN). Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab or 
      Cry1Ac caused swelling of Sf9 cells expressing HevABCC2, and caused faster swelling, 
      lysis and up to 86% mortality in cells expressing both proteins. No such effect was 
      observed in control Sf9 cells or in cells expressing only HevCaLP. The results of a 
      mixing experiment demonstrated that both proteins need to be expressed within the 
      same cell for high cytotoxicity, and suggest a novel role for HevCaLP. Binding 
      assays showed that the toxin-receptor interaction is specific. Our findings confirm 
      that HevABCC2 is the central target in Cry1A toxin mode of action, and that HevCaLP 
      plays a supporting role in increasing Cry1A toxicity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Structure-similar ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, BbT1 
      in Beauveria bassiana (Bb) and IfT1 in Isaria fumosorosea (If), were characterized. 
      METHODS: Various phenotypes including cellular antioxidant response, multidrug 
      resistance and virulence were compared between wild-type strain and the constructed 
      mutants DeltaBbT1, DeltaBbT1/BbT1 and DBbT1/IfT1. RESULTS: Compared with the 
      wild-type, DeltaBbT1/BbT1 and DeltaBbT1/ IfT1 strains showing no significant changes 
      in examined phenotypes, DeltaBbT1 became 27% to 2.1-fold less tolerant to the 
      oxidative stress of 20-40 mmol/L H2O2 and 2-8 mmol/L menadione, 28% to 4.7-fold less 
      resistant to carbendazim, itraconazole, dimetachlone, cycloheximide, ethirimol and 
      4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, and about 20% less virulent to the second-instar larvae of 
      Spodoptera litura. CONCLUSION: The ABC transporter proteins BbT1 and IfT1 are 
      similar not only in sequence structure but also in biological function, act as one 
      of the determinants for the multidrug resistance of Bb and If, and also contribute 
      to the fungal virulence due to involvement in cellular antioxidant response.

TI  - Octreotide inhibits the bilirubin carriers organic anion transporting polypeptides 
      1B1 and 1B3 and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2.

AB  - The somatostatin analog octreotide can lead to hyperbilirubinemia without evidence 
      of liver injury. Here we investigate whether octreotide inhibits the main 
      sinusoidal/canalicular bilirubin carriers and whether it is a transport substrate. 
      Octreotide showed the most potent inhibitory effect toward OATP1B1-mediated 
      transport and weaker inhibition for OATP1B3- and MRP2-mediated transport. Octreotide 
      had no effect on OATP2B1-mediated transport. Octreotide inhibited 
      [(3)H]estradiol-17-β-glucuronide (E17βG) influx mediated by OATP1B1, 1B3, and 
      multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) in a concentration-dependent 
      manner, and the IC50 values were computed to be 23 μM (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      18-29), 68 μM (95% CI 50-91), and 116.6 μM (95% CI 74.5-182.4), respectively. The 
      interaction between octreotide and OATP1B1 was further studied. Inhibition of 
      [(3)H]E17βG OATP1B1-mediated transport was purely competitive with no changes in 
      maximum transport capacity (Vmax) and a twofold Km increase when the influx kinetics 
      of [(3)H]E17βG were measured in the presence of octreotide (8.8 ± 3.1 versus 4.4 ± 
      1.2 μM, P = 0.03). The inhibition constant (Ki) of octreotide for the transport of 
      [(3)H]E17βG was calculated at 33.5 ± 5.5 μM. Uptake of radiolabeled octreotide by 
      OATP1B1-CHO cells was higher than in wild-type CHO cells and nonlabeled octreotide 
      at the extracellular compartment was able to trans-stimulate the OATP1B1-mediated 
      efflux of intracellular [(3)H]E17βG, suggesting that octreotide is a substrate of 
      OATP1B1. In summary, this study shows interaction of octreotide on the human 
      hepatocellular bilirubin transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MRP2, notably OATP1B1. 
      These findings are in line with the clinical observation that a fraction of patients 
      under treatment with octreotide exhibit hyperbilirubinemia.

TI  - Overexpression of ShCYP51B and ShatrD in Sclerotinia homoeocarpa isolates exhibiting 
      practical field resistance to a demethylation inhibitor fungicide.
PG  - 6674-82
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00417-12 [doi]
AB  - We investigated genetic factors that govern the reduced propiconazole sensitivity of 
      Sclerotinia homoeocarpa field isolates collected during a 2-year field efficacy 
      study on dollar spot disease of turf in five New England sites. These isolates 
      displayed a >50-fold range of in vitro sensitivity to a sterol demethylation 
      inhibitor (DMI) fungicide, propiconazole, making them ideal for investigations of 
      genetic mechanisms of reduced DMI sensitivity. The CYP51 gene homolog in S. 
      homoeocarpa (ShCYP51B), encoding the enzyme target of DMIs, is likely a minor 
      genetic factor for reduced propiconazole sensitivity, since there were no 
      differences in constitutive relative expression (RE) values and only 2-fold-higher 
      induced RE values for insensitive than for sensitive isolate groups. Next, we mined 
      RNA-Seq transcriptome data for additional genetic factors and found evidence for the 
      overexpression of a homolog of Botrytis cinerea atrD (BcatrD), ShatrD, a known 
      efflux transporter of DMI fungicides. The ShatrD gene showed much higher 
      constitutive and induced RE values for insensitive isolates. Several polymorphisms 
      were found upstream of ShatrD but were not definitively linked to overexpression. 
      The screening of constitutive RE values of ShCYP51B and ShatrD in isolates from two 
      golf courses that exhibited practical field resistance to propiconazole uncovered 
      evidence for significant population-specific overexpression of both genes. However, 
      linear regression demonstrated that the RE of ShatrD displays a more significant 
      relationship with propiconazole sensitivity than that of ShCYP51B. In summary, our 
      results suggest that efflux is a major determinant of the reduced DMI sensitivity of 
      S. homoeocarpa genotypes in New England, which may have implications for the 
      emergence of practical field resistance in this important turfgrass pathogen.

TI  - [Correlation on a cellular level of gene transcriptional silencing and 
      heterochromatin compartment dragging in case of PEV-producing eu-heterochromatin 
      rearrangement in Drosophila melanogaster].
PG  - 286-91
AB  - Eu-heterochromatic rearrangements transfer genes into the heterochromatin and cause 
      their variegated inactivation (PEV). Genes affected by PEV often demonstrate 
      association with heterochromatic nuclear compartment (a distinct area composed of 
      heterochromatin sequences like satellite DNA and enriched in specific chromatin 
      proteins e.g. HP1). Here, we investigate the nuclear localization and the expression 
      levels of the genes subjected to PEV caused by chromosome inversion, In(2)A4. We 
      demonstrate that the degree of PEV-caused gene inactivation depends on a 
      developmental stage, and the maximum of repression corresponds to the gene 
      expression activation period. In the case of In(2)A4 rearrangement we detect the 
      dragging of affected euchromatic region into heterochromatic nuclear compartment and 
      the increase in HP1 occupancy in this region. We developed a protocol of 
      simultaneous RNA-DNA-protein staining to demonstrate firstly in a single cell a 
      strong correlation between transcriptional activity of affected gene and its 
      distance from chromosome 2 satellite DNA.

      falciparum in Kenyan children treated with ACT.
PG  - 2001-8
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu358 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for 
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria may be threatened by parasites with reduced 
      responsiveness to artemisinins. Among 298 ACT-treated children from Mbita, Kenya, 
      submicroscopic persistence of P. falciparum on day 3 posttreatment was associated 
      with subsequent microscopically detected parasitemia at days 28 or 42. METHODS: DNA 
      sequences of resistance-associated parasite loci pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfubp1, and pfap2mu 
      were determined in the Mbita cohort before treatment, on days 2 and 3 after 
      initiation of treatment, and on the day of treatment failure. RESULTS: Parasites 
      surviving ACT on day 2 or day 3 posttreatment were significantly more likely than 
      the baseline population to carry the wild-type haplotypes of pfcrt (CVMNK at codons 
      72-76; P < .001) and pfmdr1 (NFD at codons 86, 184, 1246; P < .001). In contrast, 
      variant alleles of the novel candidate resistance genes pfap2mu (S160N/T; P = .006) 
      and pfubp-1 (E1528D; P < .001) were significantly more prevalent posttreatment. No 
      genetic similarities were found to artemisinin-tolerant parasites recently described 
      in Cambodia. CONCLUSIONS: Among treated children in western Kenya, certain P. 
      falciparum genotypes defined at pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfap2mu, and pfubp1 more often 
      survive ACT at the submicroscopic level, and contribute to onward transmission and 
      subsequent patent recrudescence.

TI  - Evaluation of reduced susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds and

AB  - The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for the biocides 
      benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine were determined against 1,602 clinical 
      isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Both compounds showed unimodal MIC and MBC 
      distributions (2 and 4 or 8 mg/liter, respectively) with no apparent subpopulation 
      with reduced susceptibility. To investigate further, all isolates were screened for 
      qac genes, and 39 of these also had the promoter region of the NorA 
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) efflux pump sequenced. The presence of qacA, qacB, qacC, 
      and qacG genes increased the mode MIC, but not MBC, to benzalkonium chloride, while 
      only qacA and qacB increased the chlorhexidine mode MIC. Isolates with a wild-type 
      norA promoter or mutations in the norA promoter had similar biocide MIC 
      distributions; notably, not all clinical isolates with norA mutations were resistant 
      to fluoroquinolones. In vitro efflux mutants could be readily selected with ethidium 
      bromide and acriflavine. Multiple passages were necessary to select mutants with 
      biocides, but these mutants showed phenotypes comparable to those of mutants 
      selected by dyes. All mutants showed changes in the promoter region of norA, but 
      these were distinct from this region of the clinical isolates. Still, none of the in 
      vitro mutants displayed fitness defects in a killing assay in Galleria mellonella 
      larvae. In conclusion, our data provide an in-depth comparative overview on efflux 
      in S. aureus mutants and clinical isolates, showing also that plasmid-encoded efflux 
      pumps did not affect bactericidal activity of biocides. In addition, current in 
      vitro tests appear not to be suitable for predicting levels of resistance that are 
      clinically relevant.

TI  - In vitro inhibition of the bile salt export pump correlates with risk of cholestatic 
      drug-induced liver injury in humans.
PG  - 130-8
LID - 10.1124/dmd.111.040758 [doi]
AB  - Inhibition of the activity of the human bile salt export pump (BSEP: ABCB11) has 
      been proposed to play a role in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). To enhance 
      understanding of the relationship between BSEP inhibition and DILI, inhibition of 
      human BSEP (hBSEP) and its rat ortholog (rBsep) by 85 pharmaceuticals was 
      investigated in vitro. This was explored using assays that quantified inhibition of 
      ATP-dependent [(3)H]taurocholate uptake into inverted plasma membrane vesicles from 
      Sf21 insect cells, which expressed the proteins. Of the pharmaceuticals, 40 
      exhibited evidence of in vitro transporter inhibition and overall a close 
      correlation was observed between potency values for inhibition of hBSEP and rBsep 
      activity (r(2) = 0.94), although 12 drugs exhibited >2-fold more potent inhibition 
      of hBSEP than rBsep. The median potency of hBSEP inhibition was higher among drugs 
      that caused cholestatic/mixed DILI than among drugs that caused hepatocellular or no 
      DILI, as was the incidence of hBSEP inhibition with IC(50) <300 μM. All drugs with 
      hBSEP IC(50) <300 μM had molecular weight >250, ClogP >1.5, and nonpolar surface 
      area >180Å. A clear distinction was not evident between hBSEP IC(50) or unbound 
      plasma concentration (C(max, u)) of the drugs in humans and whether the drugs caused 
      DILI. However, all 17 of the drugs with hBSEP IC(50) <100 μM and C(max, u) >0.002 μM 
      caused DILI. Overall, these data indicate that inhibition of hBSEP/rBsep correlates 
      with the propensity of numerous pharmaceuticals to cause cholestatic DILI in humans 
      and is associated with several of their physicochemical properties.

TI  - Regulation of the function of the human ABCG2 multidrug transporter by cholesterol 
      and bile acids: effects of mutations in potential substrate and steroid binding 
      sites.
PG  - 575-85
LID - 10.1124/dmd.113.055731 [doi]
AB  - ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2) is a plasma membrane 
      glycoprotein that actively extrudes xenobiotics and endobiotics from the cells and 
      causes multidrug resistance in cancer. In the liver, ABCG2 is expressed in the 
      canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and excretes its substrates into the bile. ABCG2 
      is known to require high membrane cholesterol content for maximal activity, and by 
      examining purified ABCG2 reconstituted in proteoliposomes we have recently shown 
      that cholesterol is an essential activator, while bile acids significantly modify 
      the activity of this protein. In the present work, by using isolated insect cell 
      membrane preparations expressing human ABCG2 and its mutant variants, we have 
      analyzed whether certain regions in this protein are involved in sterol recognition. 
      We found that replacing ABCG2-R482 with large amino acids does not affect 
      cholesterol dependence, but changes to small amino acids cause altered cholesterol 
      sensitivity. When leucines in the potential steroid-binding element (SBE, aa 
      555-558) of ABCG2 were replaced by alanines, cholesterol dependence of ABCG2 
      activity was strongly reduced, although the L558A mutant variant when purified and 
      reconstituted still required cholesterol for full activity. Regarding the effect of 
      bile acids in isolated membranes, we found that these compounds decreased 
      ABCG2-ATPase in the absence of drug substrates, which did not significantly affect 
      substrate-stimulated ATPase activity. These ABCG2 mutant variants also altered bile 
      acid sensitivity, although cholic acid and glycocholate were not transported by the 
      protein. We suggest that the aforementioned two regions in ABCG2 are important for 
      sterol sensing and may represent potential targets for pharmacologic modulation of 
      ABCG2 function.

      resistance.

AB  - Adaptation of insect phenotypes for survival after exposure to xenobiotics can 
      result from selection at multiple loci with additive genetic effects. To the 
      authors' knowledge, no selective sweep analysis has been performed to identify such 
      loci in highly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) resistant insects. Here we 
      compared a highly DDT resistant phenotype in the Drosophila melanogaster 
      (Drosophila) 91-R strain to the DDT susceptible 91-C strain, both of common origin. 
      Whole genome re-sequencing data from pools of individuals was generated separately 
      for 91-R and 91-C, and mapped to the reference Drosophila genome assembly (v. 5.72). 
      Thirteen major and three minor effect chromosome intervals with reduced nucleotide 
      diversity (π) were identified only in the 91-R population. Estimates of Tajima's D 
      (D) showed corresponding evidence of directional selection in these same genome 
      regions of 91-R, however, no similar reductions in π or D estimates were detected in 
      91-C. An overabundance of non-synonymous proteins coding to synonymous changes were 
      identified in putative open reading frames associated with 91-R. Except for NinaC 
      and Cyp4g1, none of the identified genes were the 'usual suspects' previously 
      observed to be associated with DDT resistance. Additionally, up-regulated 
      ATP-binding cassette transporters have been previously associated with DDT 
      resistance; however, here we identified a structurally altered MDR49 candidate 
      resistance gene. The remaining fourteen genes have not previously been shown to be 
      associated with DDT resistance. These results suggest hitherto unknown mechanisms of 
      DDT resistance, most of which have been overlooked in previous transcriptional 
      studies, with some genes having orthologs in mammals.

TI  - Complementation of the exoS gene in the pvdE pyoverdine synthesis gene-deficient 
      mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa results in recovery of the pvdE gene-mediated 
      penetration through the intestinal epithelial cell barrier but not the pvdE-mediated 
      virulence in silkworms.

AB  - Translocation of endogenous Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the colonized intestinal 
      tract is an important pathogenic phenomenon. Comparative genome hybridization 
      analysis of high virulent and low virulent strains allowed us to identify bacterial 
      genes that are associated with bacterial translocation from gut in infected hosts. 
      Here we focused on the pvdE pyoverdine synthesis gene among the identified bacterial 
      genes, showing that the pvdE gene is required for bacterial penetration through 
      epithelial cell monolayers and for bacterial translocation from gut to hemolymph in 
      infected silkworms. We next revealed that mRNA expression level of the exoS gene in 
      a pvdE-deficient mutant (ΔpvdE) after incubation with Caco-2 cells was greatly 
      reduced as compared with that in the wild-type strain. The pvdE- and 
      exoS-complemented ΔpvdE strains (ΔpvdE/pvdE and ΔpvdE/exoS) showed recovery of the 
      ability of bacterial penetration through Caco-2 cell monolayers and of the ability 
      of bacterial translocation from gut to hemolymph in infected silkworms. However, 
      there were differences between the ability of ΔpvdE/pvdE and ΔpvdE/exoS to kill 
      silkworms after intestinal infection and to replicate in hemolymph following direct 
      injection into the hemolymph: ΔpvdE/pvdE could kill silkworms after intestinal 
      infection and could replicate in hemolymph to levels similar to those of the 
      wild-type strain, but ΔpvdE/exoS could not. Taken together, our results suggest that 
      the virulence of the wild-strain mediated by the pvdE gene is the result of the 
      ability to both penetrate through the intestinal epithelial cell barrier depending 
      on ExoS and to replicate in hemolymph independently of ExoS.

TI  - Differential effects of membrane cholesterol content on the transport activity of 
      multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ABCC2) and of the bile salt export pump 
      (ABCB11).
PG  - 909-20

AB  - Rat canalicular membranes contain microdomains enriched in cholesterol and 
      ATP-binding cassette transporters. Cholesterol is known to regulate the activity of 
      transporters. Here, we investigated the effect of membrane cholesterol on the 
      transport kinetics of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and of bile 
      salt export pump (BSEP) variants and mutants. MRP2 and BSEP were expressed with 
      baculoviruses in insect cells, followed by vesicle isolation from control and 
      cholesterol-loaded cells (1 mM cholesterol@randomly methylated-β-cyclodextrin) for 
      transport assays. We found that cholesterol stimulates MRP2 transport activity for 
      substrates of different molecular weights: estradiol-17-β-glucuronide (E17βG), 
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cholecystokinin 8 (CCK8), and vasopressin displayed an 
      increase of Vmax and a variable decrease of Km. Kinetics of E17βG showed a sigmoidal 
      shape and a mild cooperativity in Hanes-Woolf plots in control membranes. High 
      cholesterol content shifted E17βG to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. PGE2/glutathione 
      transport followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics irrespective of cholesterol. The MRP2 
      substrates CCK8 and vasopressin exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics independent of 
      membrane cholesterol content. Transport of ochratoxin A was ATP-dependent but was 
      neither mediated by MRP2 nor stimulated by cholesterol. Transport of the two most 
      common BSEP variants p.444V/A showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics irrespective of 
      membrane cholesterol, whereby cholesterol leads to an increased Vmax while Km 
      remains unchanged. The transport activity of the BSEP mutants p.E297G and p.R432T 
      increased at high cholesterol content but did not reach the capacity of normal BSEP. 
      Hence, changing membrane cholesterol content modulates BSEP and MRP2 transport 
      kinetics differently. Cholesterol increases the transport rates of BSEP and MRP2, 
      but with the latter, may also modify the binding site as for E17βG.

TI  - Effects of the gout-causing Q141K polymorphism and a CFTR ΔF508 mimicking mutation 
      on the processing and stability of the ABCG2 protein.
PG  - 140-5
LID - S0006-291X(13)01041-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.06.054 [doi]
AB  - ABCG2 is an important multidrug transporter involved also in urate transport, thus 
      its mutations can lead to the development of gout and may also alter general drug 
      absorption, distribution and excretion. The frequent ABCG2 polymorphism, Q141K, is 
      associated with an elevated risk of gout and has been controversially reported to 
      reduce the plasma membrane expression and/or the transport function of the protein. 
      In the present work we examined the stability and cellular processing of the Q141K 
      ABCG2 variant, as well as that of the ΔF142 ABCG2, corresponding to the ΔF508 
      mutation in the CFTR (ABCC7) protein, causing cystic fibrosis. The processing and 
      localization of full length ABCG2 variants were investigated in mammalian cells, 
      followed by Western blotting and confocal microscopy, respectively. Folding and 
      stability were examined by limited proteolysis of Sf9 insect cell membranes 
      expressing these ABCG2 constructs. Stability of isolated nucleotide binding domains, 
      expressed in and purified from bacteria, was studied by CD spectroscopy. We find 
      that the Q141K variant has a mild processing defect which can be rescued by low 
      temperature, a slightly reduced activity, and a mild folding defect, especially 
      affecting the NBD. In contrast, the ΔF142 mutant has major processing and folding 
      defects, and no ATPase function. We suggest that although these mutations are both 
      localized within the NBD, based on molecular modeling their contribution to the 
      ABCG2 structure and function is different, thus rescue strategies may be devised 
      accordingly.

TI  - Intrinsic acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of a peroxisomal ATP binding cassette 
      transporter is required for transport and metabolism of fatty acids.
PG  - 1279-84
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1218034110 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisomes are organelles that perform diverse metabolic functions in different 
      organisms, but a common function is β-oxidation of a variety of long chain 
      aliphatic, branched, and aromatic carboxylic acids. Import of substrates into 
      peroxisomes for β-oxidation is mediated by ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
      proteins of subfamily D, which includes the human adrenoleukodystropy protein (ALDP) 
      defective in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Whether substrates are 
      transported as CoA esters or free acids has been a matter of debate. Using COMATOSE 
      (CTS), a plant representative of the ABCD family, we demonstrate that there is a 
      functional and physical interaction between the ABC transporter and the peroxisomal 
      long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACS)6 and -7. We expressed recombinant CTS in 
      insect cells and showed that membranes from infected cells possess fatty acyl-CoA 
      thioesterase activity, which is stimulated by ATP. A mutant, in which Serine 810 is 
      replaced by asparagine (S810N) is defective in fatty acid degradation in vivo, 
      retains ATPase activity but has strongly reduced thioesterase activity, providing 
      strong evidence for the biological relevance of this activity. Thus, CTS, and most 
      likely the other ABCD family members, represent rare examples of polytopic membrane 
      proteins with an intrinsic additional enzymatic function that may regulate the entry 
      of substrates into the β-oxidation pathway. The cleavage of CoA raises questions 
      about the side of the membrane where this occurs and this is discussed in the 
      context of the peroxisomal coenzyme A (CoA) budget.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of the couch potato (CPO) protein reveals an expression

AB  - The couch potato (CPO) protein is a key biomolecule involved in regulating diapause 
      through the RNA-binding process of the peripheral and central nervous systems in 
      insects and also recently discovered in a few crustacean species. As such, 
      ectoparasitic copepods are interesting model species that have no evidence of 
      developmental arrest. The present study is the first to report on the cloning of a 
      putative CPO gene from the salmon louse Caligus rogercresseyi (CrCPO), as identified 
      by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. In addition, the transcription 
      expression in larvae and adults was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. The 
      CrCPO cDNA sequence showed 3261 base pairs (bp), consisting of 713bp of 5' UTR, 
      1741bp of 3' UTR, and an open reading frame of 807bp encoding for 268 amino acids. 
      The highly conserved RNA binding regions RNP2 (LFVSGL) and RNP1 (SPVGFVTF), as well 
      the dimerization site (LEF), were also found. Furthermore, eight single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms located in the untranslated regions and one located in the coding 
      region were detected. Gene transcription analysis revealed that CrCPO has ubiquitous 
      expression across larval stages and in adult individuals, with the highest 
      expression from nauplius to copepodid stages. The present study suggests a putative 
      biological function of CrCPO associated with the development of the nervous system 
      in salmon lice and contributes molecular evidence for candidate genes related to 
      host-parasite interactions.

TI  - The ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C member 2 in Bombyx mori larvae is a 
      functional receptor for Cry toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis.
PG  - 1782-94

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely used biopesticide, and its Cry toxin genes 
      are essential transgenes for the generation of insect-resistant transgenic crops. 
      Recent reports have suggested that ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C2 
      (ABCC2) proteins are implicated in Cry intoxication, and that a single amino acid 
      insertion results in high levels of resistance to Cry1 toxins. However, there is 
      currently no available direct evidence of functional interactions between ABCC2 and 
      Cry toxins. To address this important knowledge gap, we investigated the role of 
      Bombyx mori ABCC2 (BmABCC2) or its mutant from a Cry1Ab-resistant B. mori strain on 
      Cry1A toxin action. When we expressed BmABCC2 ectopically on Sf9 cells, it served as 
      a functional receptor, and the single amino acid insertion found in BmABCC2 from 
      Cry1Ab-resistant larvae resulted in lack of susceptibility to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac. 
      Using the same expression system, we found that Bo. mori cadherin-like receptor 
      (BtR175) conferred susceptibility to Cry1A toxins, albeit to a lower degree than 
      BmABCC2. Coexpression of BtR175 and BmABCC2 resulted in the highest cell 
      susceptibility to Cry1A, Cry1F, and even the phylogenetically distant Cry8Ca toxin, 
      when compared with expression of either receptor alone. The susceptibility observed 
      in the coexpressing cells and that in Bo. mori larvae are likely to be correlated, 
      suggesting that BtR175 and BmABCC2 are important factors determining larval 
      susceptibility. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, Cry toxin receptor 
      functionality for ABCC2, and highlights the crucial role of this protein and 
      cadherin in the mechanism of action of Cry toxin.

TI  - Differential functional rescue of Lys(513) and Lys(516) processing mutants of MRP1

AB  - Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) extrudes drugs as well as pharmacologically 
      and physiologically important organic anions across the plasma membrane in an 
      ATP-dependent manner. We previously showed that Ala substitutions of Lys(513) and 
      Lys(516) in the cytoplasmic loop (CL5) connecting transmembrane helix 9 (TM9) to 
      TM10 cause misfolding of MRP1, abrogating its expression at the plasma membrane in 
      transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Exposure of HEK cells to the 
      chemical chaperones glycerol, DMSO, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 4-aminobutyric 
      acid (4-PBA) improved levels of K513A to wild-type MRP1 levels but transport 
      activity was only fully restored by 4-PBA or DMSO treatments. Tryptic fragmentation 
      patterns and conformation-dependent antibody immunoreactivity of the 
      transport-deficient PEG- and glycerol-rescued K513A proteins indicated that the 
      second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2) had adopted a more open conformation than in 
      wild-type MRP1. This structural change was accompanied by differences in ATP binding 
      and hydrolysis but no changes in substrate Km. In contrast to K513A, K516A levels in 
      HEK cells were not significantly enhanced by chemical chaperones. In more permissive 
      insect cells, however, K516A levels were comparable to wild-type MRP1. Nevertheless, 
      organic anion transport by K516A in insect cell membranes was reduced by >80% due to 
      reduced substrate Km. Tryptic fragmentation patterns indicated a more open 
      conformation of the third membrane spanning domain of MRP1. Thus, despite their 
      close proximity to one another in CL5, Lys(513) and Lys(516) participate in 
      different interdomain interactions crucial for the proper folding and assembly of 
      MRP1.

TI  - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator VX-770 
      (ivacaftor) opens the defective channel gate of mutant CFTR in a 
      phosphorylation-dependent but ATP-independent manner.
PG  - 36639-49
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.393637 [doi]
AB  - The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) acts as a channel on 
      the apical membrane of epithelia. Disease-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
      gene can lead to CFTR protein misfolding as in the case of the F508del mutation 
      and/or channel dysfunction. Recently, a small molecule, VX-770 (ivacaftor), has 
      shown efficacy in restoring lung function in patients bearing the G551D mutation, 
      and this has been linked to repair of its channel gating defect. However, these 
      studies did not reveal the mechanism of action of VX-770 in detail. Normally, CFTR 
      channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation, ATP binding, and hydrolysis. 
      Hence, it has been hypothesized that VX-770 modifies one or more of these metabolic 
      events. In this study, we examined VX-770 activity using a reconstitution system for 
      purified CFTR protein, a system that enables control of known regulatory factors. We 
      studied the consequences of VX-770 interaction with CFTR incorporated in planar 
      lipid bilayers and in proteoliposomes, using a novel flux-based assay. We found that 
      purified and phosphorylated CFTR was potentiated in the presence of Mg-ATP, 
      suggesting that VX-770 bound directly to the CFTR protein, rather than associated 
      kinases or phosphatases. Interestingly, we also found that VX-770 enhanced the 
      channel activity of purified and mutant CFTR in the nominal absence of Mg-ATP. These 
      findings suggest that VX-770 can cause CFTR channel opening through a 
      nonconventional ATP-independent mechanism. This work sets the stage for future 
      studies of the structural properties that mediate CFTR gating using VX-770 as a 
      probe.

TI  - Glutathione-conjugated sulfanylalkanols are substrates for ABCC11 and γ-glutamyl 
      transferase 1: a potential new pathway for the formation of odorant precursors in 
      the apocrine sweat gland.
PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1111/exd.12354 [doi]
AB  - We have previously shown that precursors of odorous components characteristic of 
      axillary sweat are hardly detectable or undetectable in individuals carrying the 
      538G > A SNP in the ABCC11 transporter gene. However, it is unclear, whether ABCC11 
      is directly involved in the transport of these compounds. To approach this question, 
      transport of peptide-conjugated potential precursors of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexanol 
      (3M3SH), a key determinant of axillary malodour, was measured using membrane 
      vesicles of Sf9 insect cells overexpressing human ABCC11. Whilst no ABCC11-mediated 
      transport was detected for the dipeptide precursor Cys-Gly-3M3SH, the glutathione 
      conjugate of 3M3SH (SG-3M3SH) was robustly taken up by ABCC11 at a transport rate of 
      0.47 pmol/mg/min. Collectively, these results illuminate SG-3M3SH as a putative 
      precursor of 3M3SH, which then may undergo intra-vesicular maturation to generate 
      Cys-Gly-3M3SH. Critically, the apocrine sweat gland was demonstrated to express 
      γ-glutamyl transferase 1 (GGT1) protein, which is known to catalyse the 
      deglutamylation of glutathionyl conjugates. Additionally, we provide evidence that 
      recombinant and isolated hepatic human GGT1 is capable of transforming SG-3M3SH to 
      Cys-Gly-3M3SH in vitro. To sum up, we demonstrate that the functionality of ABCC11 
      is likely to play an important role in the generation of axillary malodour. 
      Furthermore, we identify GGT1 as a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of 
      Cys-Gly-3M3SH.

TI  - Modulation of P-glycoprotein ATPase of Helicoverpa armigera by cholesterol: effects 
      on ATPase activity and interaction of insecticides.
PG  - 47-60
LID - 10.1002/arch.21004 [doi]
AB  - Purified P-glycoprotein ATPase from Helicoverpa armigera (Ha-Pgp), reconstituted in 
      proteoliposomes composed of phospholipids and cholesterol, shows higher ATPase 
      activity in the presence of cholesterol than in its absence. The Ha-Pgp ATPase 
      activity was increased 30-40% with cholesterol. The KM for ATP was found to be 1 and 
      0.8 mM in the absence and presence of cholesterol, respectively. The 
      insecticide-stimulated Ha-Pgp ATPase activity was increased by 10-20% for all the 
      insecticides in the reconstituted proteoliposomes containing cholesterol compared to 
      those with no cholesterol. The effects of cholesterol on KM and Vmax values of 
      insecticide-stimulated Ha-Pgp ATPase activity were unrelated to the size of the 
      insecticide. Ha-Pgp tryptophan fluorescence displayed a red shift of 3 and 8 nm in 
      emission spectra upon binding of insecticides. Cholesterol enhances the interaction 
      of insecticides with Ha-Pgp. Kd values of different insecticides for binding to 
      Ha-Pgp were found to be lower in the presence of cholesterol in the proteoliposomes 
      compared to its absence. Results suggest that cholesterol plays a role in the 
      recognition and interaction of insecticides by modulating Ha-Pgp ATPase and may be 
      involved in efflux of insecticides from cells by the transporter.
